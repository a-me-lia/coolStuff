      "raw": "\nMy biggest accomplishment of 2022 was not my own, but the collective work of folks on my teams at Vercel. They've chosen to join me on this ambitious journey to make the web faster. I'd like to share the internal Slack message I wrote to celebrate their amazing work:\n\n---\n\n**Happy new year!** What better way to start 2023 than to celebrate the work the Developer Experience teams accomplished in 2022:\n\n- Our monthly active community members **grew by 66%**, as measured by activity on Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and more. Our teams play a key role in helping grow, educate, and interact with members of the community. We even helped [many folks land jobs](https://twitter.com/nutlope/status/1512462016614703115) from our [Next.js job board](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/43787).\n- We helped engage and answer questions from the community, resulting in [Discord](https://nextjs.org/discord) **growing 2x in size**, Reddit ([/r/nextjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/)) **growing 3x in size**, and Next.js being one of the [top tags on StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1605997497976885248) with **96% growth**. This is largely a reverse kudos to the Next.js team!\n- The DevRel team hosted community meetups in [New York](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1509384199899332611), [Austin](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1531695305766445056), and [San Francisco](https://twitter.com/nutlope/status/1542927703166181377). We also spoke at 15 events, meeting with thousands of developers across the frontend community.\n- It was a company wide effort, but we played a major part in Next.js Conf, which **55,000+** attended and **110,000+** registered. Delba, Lydia, and I were part of the [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiknNI_0J48&list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq&index=4), Delba and I hosted the [preshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93D-XH0tNRY&list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq&index=2), Hassan helped organize and select our [28 amazing community speakers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq), and the rest of the team was involved in various other ways.\n- We supported many different product launches across Vercel, including Next.js ([v13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13), [v12.3](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-3), [v12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2), [v12.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1)), [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-edge-middleware-dynamic-at-the-speed-of-static), [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/blog/edge-functions-generally-available), [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/blog/edge-config-public-beta), [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-acquires-splitbee), [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/blog/build-output-api), [Turbopack](https://vercel.com/blog/turbopack), [Vercel OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images), [Comments for Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/blog/making-live-reviews-a-reality-enhanced-preview-experience), and more. Depending on the launch, we help out with early testing of features, providing feedback on the API, or reviewing content / messaging for the launch.\n- Our team helps write and approve content for social media. In 2022, we saw [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vercel) followers grow by **32%**, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/VercelHQ) subscribers grow by **78%** (**~1.5M views**, up 250% from last year), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/16181286/admin/) followers grow by **145%**. We can't take full credit, though, so kudos to the rest of y'all for creating products and content folks want to try and learn about.\n- Thousands of tweets and hundreds of direct messages later, we spent a considerable amount of time “digging deep” with customers to gather feedback on Vercel and Next.js and relay that feedback back to the team.\n- We launched a [brand new free Next.js course](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira/status/1503409381081325571), teaching the foundations of React and Next.js for beginners to get started. It's been continually maintained and updated throughout the year, based on community feedback. Hard to fathom, but the Next.js `/learn` courses have had **17 million page views** in 2022. Kudos to Delba!\n- Our Vercel product documentation has had some major upgrades, including: framework-aware dynamic content, JavaScript/TypeScript toggles, improved search accuracy, a new table of contents, as well as refactoring many different pages and beginning to restructure the information architecture of the main navigation.\n- We helped update a number of webpages, including: [/blog](https://vercel.com/blog) (categories and new design), [/customers](https://vercel.com/customers) (industry pages and new design), [/help](https://vercel.com/help) (improved search and new design), [/guides](https://vercel.com/guides) (searching and filtering), [/templates](https://vercel.com/templates) (brand new, over 100+ templates), and more.\n\nAnd a few shoutouts…\n\n- **[Steph](https://twitter.com/steph_dietz_)** created a [written + video course on SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/beginner-sveltekit), also helping amplify the well-received [SvelteKit 1.0 launch](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0). Along the way, she also created [SvelteKit Commerce](https://vercel.com/templates/svelte/sveltekit-commerce) as part of the course – a fantastic template for folks to get started with SvelteKit 1.0. Great work, Steph!\n- **[Steven](https://twitter.com/steventey)** created the [Vercel Platforms Starter Kit](https://demo.vercel.pub/platforms-starter-kit), enabling companies of [all sizes](https://twitter.com/bdougieYO/status/1484244164908752896) to build multi-tenant applications on Vercel. [Hashnode](https://townhall.hashnode.com/powerful-and-superfast-hashnode-blogs-now-powered-by-nextjs-11-and-vercel) is now our most popular platform on Vercel, with almost 30,000 custom domains added. He believed in this template so much, he built an entire [open-source Bitly alternative](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1572958186667233282) with it. Now that's dogfooding!\n- **[Hassan](https://twitter.com/nutlope)** built our incredible [image gallery template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/image-gallery-starter), used to show photos from Next.js Conf 2022. It features many nice UI touches, like images with placeholders, lazy loading, and size optimization. There's keyboard support, direct URLs (e.g.: `/p/2`) and more. The quality of this template is what we aspire to achieve with all of our examples, and Hassan managed to also uncover and relay some important product feedback back about Next.js and the image component.\n- **[Lydia](https://twitter.com/lydiahallie)** created a blog, video, and full tutorial on how to [create your own web framework](https://vercel.com/blog/build-your-own-web-framework), built on top of Vercel's [Build Output API](https://twitter.com/vercel/status/1550488364851363840). This was a very ambitious project and showcased Lydia's expertise as a creator and engineer. Her [writing](https://twitter.com/lydiahallie/status/1504459707750174722) has been [incredibly detailed](https://twitter.com/lydiahallie/status/1601247706307256323) and illustrated, with folks saying it's “[one of the best I read this year](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1602732309232459782)”.\n- **[Delba](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira)** has single-handedly re-written the vast majority of the Next.js documentation for the [new](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) `app` [directory (beta) docs](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs). It's some of the best docs I've ever seen. Not only are there new overviews for fundamentals like [routing](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/fundamentals), [rendering](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/fundamentals), and [data fetching](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/fundamentals), she's also designed and added many illustrations to visualize concepts. Many of these docs built off her previous work on the [Layouts RFC](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc).\n- **[Rich](https://twitter.com/studio_hungry)** has laid the groundwork for many future product docs improvements, including my favorite which is the framework-aware code blocks and content sections in the docs. With this, we'll be able to make strides towards customers having a preferred framework selected and remembered across Vercel, so the docs are always in the context of your favorite framework syntax. Well done!\n- **[Michael](https://twitter.com/manovotny)** joined just a few months ago to lead the DevRel team and has already shipped an incredible post on [moving from React + Express + Webpack to Next.js](https://vercel.com/blog/migrating-a-large-open-source-react-application-to-next-js-and-vercel), resulting in removing 20,000+ lines of code and 30+ dependencies. The post has been [well received](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1609023938486575112) by the community. He's a fantastic leader and I'm thrilled to see him grow, mentor, and lead the DevRel team.\n\nIncredibly proud of everything y'all have accomplished – onward to 2023!\n",

      "raw": "\nThere's been massive innovation in the database and backend space for developers building applications with serverless and edge compute. There are new tools, companies, and even programming models that simplify how developers store data.\n\nThis post will be an overview of databases that pair well with modern application and compute providers.\n\n## Criteria\n\nI'll focus on **transactional¹** workloads instead of analytical² workloads.\n\nThe “backend” space is vast: search, analytics, data science, and more – so I'll niche down here. The primary criteria of this overview is:\n\n1. Services that work exceptionally well when paired with serverless and edge compute\n2. Services that work with JavaScript and TypeScript codebases\n\n> **Disclaimer:** I work at Vercel, which partners with companies in this post. I also have personally used many of these tools for my own personal projects. My site currently uses PlanetScale and I'm also an angel investor in Supabase (mentioned below).\n\n## A new programming model\n\nRelational databases have been around for 25+ years.\n\nWhile there are new companies creating _serverless-first_ storage solutions, a new programming model is required for workloads to be compatible with serverless compute and modern runtimes.\n\nThese solutions must be:\n\n- **Connectionless:** Developers don't want to think about manual connection management. Traditional database protocols are stateful, whereas HTTP is mostly stateless, making it easier to use with scale to zero compute. Exposed through an SDK or HTTP API, “connectionless” solutions provide an **abstraction over connection pooling**.\n- **Web native:** Browser data-fetching APIs (e.g. Web `fetch`) and protocols are eating the world. New databases use HTTP APIs or WebSockets, rather than opening direct connections to the database. This makes them compatible with all forms of compute (including the lighter runtime used in edge compute).\n- **Lightweight:** Client libraries (and drivers) are becoming thin. Complexity is shifting to the database vendor, taking on the burden as part of their global infrastructure. For example, their gateway might handle connection pooling or provide caching infrastructure. This has led to a new wave of ORMs (i.e. abstractions to query data) both as standalone libraries and as integrated database SDKs.\n- **(Bonus) Type-safe:** TypeScript developers are favoring databases or libraries which provide tooling to enable type-safe access to your data. For example: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely), [Drizzle](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm), [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), and [Zapatos](https://jawj.github.io/zapatos/).\n\nConsider databases like Postgres. New solutions like Neon and Supabase abstract connection management, providing you with a simple way to query and mutate data. In the case of Supabase, there's a client library that uses an HTTP API [built on PostgREST](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api):\n\n```jsx\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\nlet supabase = createClient('https://<project>.supabase.co', '<your-anon-key>');\nlet { data } = await supabase.from('countries').select();\n```\n\nAnd for Neon:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Client } from '@neondatabase/serverless';\nlet client = new Client(env.DATABASE_URL);\nlet {\n  rows: [{ now }],\n} = await client.query('select now();');\n```\n\nNeon's solution is [particularly interesting](https://neon.tech/blog/serverless-driver-for-postgres/).\n\n> The basic premise is simple: our driver redirects the PostgreSQL wire protocol via a special proxy. Our driver connects from the edge function to the proxy over a WebSocket, telling the proxy which database host and port it wants to reach. The proxy opens a TCP connection to that host and port and relays traffic in both directions.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Neon architecture diagram for connection pooling`}\n  src={`/images/backend/neon.png`}\n  width={1600}\n  height={840}\n/>\n\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\n\nUsing WebSockets, instead of HTTP, does have tradeoffs. There might be additional latency on the first request setup, but subsequent requests are faster. There's an [RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9220.pdf) for WebSockets with `HTTP/3` which would remove that extra network roundtrip.\n\n</Callout>\n\nThe connection management isn't going away – it's just being handled by the vendor now.\n\nThere's even solutions like PlanetScale which can handle up to [a million connections](https://planetscale.com/blog/one-million-connections), which also allows you to effectively never think about managing connections.\n\n## Trends\n\nThis new programming model has created emerging trends for database companies:\n\n- Databases are increasingly becoming **data platforms**, including other adjacent solutions like full-text search and analytics.\n- The **decoupling of storage and compute**, popularized by Snowflake (and more), is enabling new players (e.g. Neon et al.) to massively reduce the cost of a “database at rest”. This pairs well with frontend git branch-based workflows, where you want to scale to zero when not being used.\n- Increasingly developers **don't want to “dial the knobs”**. Solutions like DynamoDB (and in some ways S3) provided infinite scale without needing to tweak memory, storage, CPU, clusters, and instances.\n- The dream of **global data** is here, but not how it was predicted. Trying to replicate _all_ data to _every_ network edge is probably not the correct solution most times. Instead, we're seeing specialized data APIs and the emergence of user-specific data stores (e.g. for shopping cart data).\n- More databases are **embracing serverless**, but what “serverless” means to them varies. There are different vectors of autoscaling: connections, storage, compute, and more.\n\n## Databases\n\nI'll bucket these into “established” and “rising” categories, serverless/serverful, as well as generally available (GA) and pre-GA. I'll also mostly talk about managed vendors.\n\nFor example, you can of course run MySQL or Postgres on major cloud providers like AWS. There's a long tail of niche data storage solutions, so some will definitely be missing that I haven't heard of or used.\n\n### Established serverless solutions\n\n- **DynamoDB**\n  - **[AWS DynamoDB:](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)** Fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database.\n- **Firebase**\n  - **[Firestore:](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)** Over 10 years old now, Firestore is a well-adopted document database. One unique advantage Firebase is its built-in support for authentication, real-time workloads, and cross-platform support for mobile.\n- **MongoDB**\n  - [Atlas Serverless:](https://www.mongodb.com/use-cases/serverless) MongoDB has an entire data platform, including search / analytics / etc. Their recent investment into serverless is very exciting, with Atlas Serverless now [generally available](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/embrace-benefits-serverless-development-atlas). Their [Data API](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/api/data-api/) makes them a fantastic pair for serverless / edge.\n- **MySQL**\n  - **[PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/):** MySQL through [Vitess](https://planetscale.com/blog/all-the-tech-planetscale-replaces). Can easily handle quite a [large](https://planetscale.com/blog/one-million-queries-per-second-with-mysql) [scale](https://planetscale.com/blog/one-million-connections) and also includes some nice features to [speed up](https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-planetscale-boost) and [monitor](https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-planetscale-insights-advanced-query-monitoring) queries. Their [serverless driver](https://planetscale.com/blog/introducing-the-planetscale-serverless-driver-for-javascript) (`@planetscale/database`) has been easy to use, but I prefer [Kysely](https://github.com/depot/kysely-planetscale).\n- **PostgreSQL**\n  - **[AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/):** One of the first serverless Postgres offerings.\n  - **[CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/announcing-cockroachdb-serverless/):** Autoscales and distributes data across multiple nodes. Focused on high data consistency and integrity. Supports most of Postgres but not stored procedures and extensions.\n- **Redis**\n  - **[Upstash](https://upstash.com/):** Offers durable/consistent Redis, global replication options, and Kafka. Fantastic `@upstash/redis` HTTP/REST client library.\n\n### Rising serverless database solutions\n\n- **Generally Available (GA)**\n  - **[Fauna](https://fauna.com/):** They were an early mover in the serverless data space. I've had success with their GraphQL APIs before, but feel mostly indifferent on [FQL](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/fql/).\n- **Pre-GA**\n  - **[Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)**: Fantastic for real-time workloads, but also a very simple, type-safe interface for querying/mutating data. You write (and think) in functions. Pairs well with React's mental model.\n  - **[Grafbase](https://grafbase.com/)**: If you love GraphQL, Grafbase is worth exploring. Designed to integrate into branch-based workflows + fast reads globally. Realtime and full-text search are in the works.\n  - **[Neon:](https://neon.tech/)** Postgres with separation of storage and compute. Uniquely designed for serverless and works with the native Postgres driver + supports database branching workflows.\n  - **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/):** Open-source, built-on pure Postgres. [Database](https://supabase.com/database) + [Auth](https://supabase.com/auth) + [Storage](https://supabase.com/storage) and more. Scales up on pay-as-you-go, and [working on scale to zero](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-series-b#where-were-going).\n  - **[Xata](https://xata.io/)**: Not only a database, but search / analytics as well. I'm a fan of their spreadsheet-like UI, which is approachable for a wider audience.\n- _+ Long tail of new providers that can do DB hosting (Railway, Render, Fly, etc)._\n\n### Stateful backends and other solutions\n\n- **Generally Available (GA)**\n  - **[AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb):** Very exciting innovation coming from Google. AlloyDB is unique because it can handle both transactional¹ and analytical² workloads.\n  - **[Ably](https://ably.com/):** Realtime infrastructure with [queues support](https://ably.com/docs/general/queues) and other message durability options.\n  - **[Crunchy Postgres](https://www.crunchydata.com/):** Crunchy Postgres is [\"just Postgres\"](https://changelog.com/news/just-postgres-LWm4). Focused on performance and availability, cost-effectiveness, and supporting all native Postgres features.\n  - **[Hasura:](https://hasura.io/)** Makes it easy to connect data from many different sources and expose it as a GraphQL API. Can use Neon under-the-hood as the database provider.\n  - **[Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/):** Realtime collaboration infrastructure, they offer persistent [conflict-free data](https://liveblocks.io/conflict-free-data-types) along with APIs for document browsing, permissions management, database sync. Beautiful design and documentation.\n  - **[Replicache](https://replicache.dev/)**: More of a database _synchronization engine_ that can be coupled with other solutions with no real-time solution. We use this for [comments on Vercel previews](https://vercel.com/blog/making-live-reviews-a-reality-enhanced-preview-experience).\n  - **[TimeScale](https://www.timescale.com/):** For both transactional and analytical workloads. Adds many features found in NoSQL databases to Postgres, and also integrates with S3 for storage.\n- **Pre-GA**\n  - **[ChiselStrike](https://www.chiselstrike.com/):** Write your TypeScript class, generate an API. Really leaning into the “infrastructure from code” approach, you write and think in functions, somewhat similar to Convex.\n  - **[EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/):** EdgeDB is challenging the status quo. Particularly the “merger” between ORM / database, more than just a query builder, but a way to _optimize_ queries.\n  - **[Nhost:](https://nhost.io/)** Firebase, but with GraphQL. Built on Hasura, Postgres, and S3.\n  - [Rowy:](https://www.rowy.io) Low-code, spreadsheet-like backend (almost like an open-source Airtable) but they also have the ability to write functions to mutate data.\n  - [SurrealDB:](https://surrealdb.com/) Has its own SQL-flavored syntax, also trying to provide the spreadsheet-like UI for viewing data (still waitlist access, haven't used it).\n  - **[Tigris:](https://www.tigrisdata.com/)** Document database, focused on real-time and also includes full-text search.\n  - **[WunderGraph:](https://wundergraph.com/)** Trying to lead with an excellent ORM / client library (end-to-end type safety, GraphQL support) and wedge into a cloud product (still waitlist access, haven't used it).\n- **Other Solutions**\n  - **Caching Engines:** [Stellate](https://stellate.co/), [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate), [ReadySet](https://readyset.io/).\n  - **Cloud Provider Offerings:** Azure SQL, Azure CosmosDB, Google Cloud SQL, Google BigTable, and many more.\n  - **Content Management (Headless CMS):** These can still act as a database, just a different domain-specific solution. [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/), [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), [Sitecore](https://www.sitecore.com/), and more.\n\n---\n\n¹ Commonly referred to as OLTP (Online _Transactional_ Processing). These are for CRUD operations, most commonly the MySQL and Postgres databases of the world.\n\n² Commonly referred to as OLAP (Online _Analytical_ Processing).

    "body": {
      "raw": "\nHow did I go from a designer to a developer? In this post, I'll share my overnight success story – ten years in the making. First, we have to go way back to 2007.\n\n## Learning Design\n\nI was 14 and found myself fully immersed in the internet. Like many kids, I was an avid gamer. One of my favorites was Halo. I was on their gaming forums chatting with other Halo players. And for those around my age, you might remember something special at the bottom of every post - forum signature banners.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Old forum banners`}\n  src={`/images/career/banners.png`}\n  width={1280}\n  height={720}\n  priority\n/>\n\nThese were _so cool_. I thought \"I need to have one\". Luckily, I happened to grow up in the internet age. YouTube was getting popular and you could find tutorials on anything your heart desired.\n\nSo, 14-year-old me managed to follow the _sound_ advice of others online and download a _completely_ legal version of Photoshop (thanks Pirate Bay) to create my own banners. I learned about vectors, brush packs, masking, typography, you name it. And before I knew it, I was actually _pretty good_ at design.\n\n> **Takeaway:** Follow your curiosity.\n\n## Working as a Designer\n\nI continued to use my Photoshop skills mostly for practical jokes, like photoshopping my friends into epic landscapes or other silly things. When I turned 16, I was looking for a summer job and realized I had actually developed _marketable skills_ in the process of following my curiosity. A local t-shirt company was hiring designers to create vector illustrations for sports teams, events, schools, and more. You know, this kind.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Shirt designs`}\n  src={`/images/career/shirts.png`}\n  width={1280}\n  height={720}\n/>\n\nI applied, and surprisingly, I got hired. That summer, I churned out designs and learned more about Adobe Illustrator than I could have imagined. As high school graduation approached, it seemed natural I would continue with design in college (university). But a looming fear of a career as a designer led me to explore other options.\n\nI was worried about job stability and the intense cirriculum for designers at my college. In retrospect, I didn't have great guidance (easy to say in hindsight). Ultimately, I made the jump for engineering.\n\n> **Takeaway:** Chase your passions. You might just learn some valuable skills along the way.\n\n## Becoming an Engineer\n\nI started college and learned to code in 2011. I chose Computer Engineering because I built my own gaming computer once, and I was the \"IT\" person for my friends and family. Not exactly a strong foundation to build a career upon.\n\nMy first class was _Introduction to Computer Programming_. My professor asked, \"How many have had prior programming experience?\". More than half the class raised their hands. My hand stayed down. I became nervous.\n\nI struggled throughout my first year of school, scraping by with average grades and low self-esteem. I wanted to quit. \"I'm not smart enough to be a programmer\", I thought. In hindsight, I was actually just _learning the wrong things for me_.\n\n## What Didn't Work For Me\n\nIn our curriculum, students started out by learning the C programming language. For me, C was not the most enjoyable language to work with. I would be fine never having to manually allocate memory ever again. The only part that sparked joy was visualizing command line output.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main( int argc, char *argv[] )  {\n   if( argc == 2 ) {\n      printf(\"The argument supplied is %s\\\\n\", argv[1]);\n   }\n   else if( argc > 2 ) {\n      printf(\"Too many arguments supplied.\\\\n\");\n   }\n   else {\n      printf(\"One argument expected.\\\\n\");\n   }\n}\n```\n\nFor example, if I ran the program above and forwarded `hello` on the command line, I'd see `The argument supplied is hello`. Incredible! While I dreaded almost everything about C, it did start teaching me the fundamentals of programming: variables, loops, functions, and more.\n\nNext, we learned Java. This was a big improvement over C for me. No more [manual memory management](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>)! And even more visual applications: [Java Swing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)>). Now we're talking!\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Java Swing program`}\n  src={`/images/career/swing.png`}\n  width={1280}\n  height={720}\n/>\n\nThe next semester we learned web development. This is where the pieces began to fall into place for me. The visual aspect of the web felt like the missing link between design and development. The web felt like a place I could experiment, build, and most importantly **share with anyone**.\n\n> **Takeaway:** To learn what's right for you, cast a wide net. Try many things.\n\n## Humble Beginnings\n\nEven though I was excited about the web, building web apps in 2012 wasn't as beginner-friendly as it is today. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and even that [Bootstrap](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)>) library. Simple websites made sense, but then I was exposed to the world of back-end development... what in the world is a LAMP stack!? [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) reared its ugly head again.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`LAMP stack`}\n  src={`/images/career/lamp.png`}\n  width={1280}\n  height={401}\n/>\n\nNevertheless, I passed my web development classes with higher marks and ended up landing an internship. It wasn't exactly what I wanted -- I was writing automated tests. But I got my foot in the door. I started to learn what a career as a Software Engineer looked like.\n\nOne internship led to two, and then three, and finally a full-time job after graduating [with honors](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cum_laude). Quite a turnaround from wanting to drop out and quit programming just a few years prior. My determination and perseverance paid off.\n\n> **Takeaway:** You're not a failure if your first job isn't at a well-known company. Every company will teach you something new about how to build software.\n\n## Exponential Growth\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"826528907381739520\" />\n\nWhile I enjoyed web development, the front-end never _fully clicked_ for me until I started using React a few years later in my first full-time job. Up until this point, most \"modern web development\" at the time seemed so complex. Learning React, and then starting to use Create React App, helped me finally break free from JavaScript build tool hell and focus on building great websites. This is when I started to grow exponentially as a developer.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Anatomy of a React component`}\n  src={`/images/career/react-dark.png`}\n  width={1280}\n  height={720}\n/>\n\nSpecializing on one specific thing (React) led to a snowball effect. Suddenly, I was becoming proficient in other related skills. Understanding the fundamentals led to faster adoption of the next layer of tools, and finally to understanding and creating my own backends and APIs.\n\n> **Takeaway:** Learning React is a safe bet. The principles of React have fundamentally changed how we build for the web.\n\n## The Present\n\nI've now been working with React since 2015. Since then I've largely been a product engineer, working in financial tech and e-commerce. About three years ago, I realized I wanted to make a shift in my career.\n\nI wanted to create. I wanted to write, record, stream, post, tweet, and grow a community. I wanted to help others learn and progress in their careers as developers. After teaching over 100,000 developers from around the world with courses and tutorials, I joined the team at Vercel and now lead [Developer Relations](https://leerob.io/blog/head-of-devrel).\n\n> **Takeaway:** It's never too late to change your trajectory. Your career is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n## Takeaways & Advice\n\n1. Follow your curiosity.\n1. Chase your passions. You might just learn some valuable skills along the way.\n1. To learn what's right for you, cast a wide net. Try many things.\n1. You're not a failure if your first job isn't at a well-known company. Every company will teach you something new about how to build software. You'll probably only be working there for a few years anyway, on average at least.\n1. Learning React is a safe bet. The principles of React have fundamentally changed how we build for the web.\n1. It's never too late to change your trajectory. Your career is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nAlso, share your work. Tell people what you're building or learning. It sounds obvious, but learning in public and sharing my findings helped me land multiple jobs in my career.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1334334544598740994\" />\n\n- A good boot camp is better than an average degree (for programming).\n- You don't need formal education, but if you forego traditional structure and community, you must recreate it yourself.\n- Create an [online presence](/blog/beginners-guide-to-the-programming-portfolio#why-do-you-need-a-portfolio). Showcase your work. [Write](/blog/teach-online#writing-online). Share what you've learned. Attract other like-minded people. Create serendipity.\n\nThe best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is today.\n",

      "raw": "\nFor startups, having product-market fit means you're building the right product for the right people. For DevRel, having community-messaging fit means you're using the right words to describe the product for that community.\n\nThis post will outline a few examples of how I've found community-messaging fit and some tips to help you iterate with your messaging.\n\n## What is Community-Messaging Fit?\n\nMarketing to developers should be **clear** and **relatable**.\n\n- **Clear**—_not_ simple. The product often isn't simple, but the impact can be clear. If your explanation isn't clear yet, iterate and try again.\n- **Relatable**—_not_ obscure. Use language or analogies the community is familiar with. Connect new concepts with existing technologies or mental models.\n\nYour community members have unique backgrounds. They've learned to code from university, bootcamps, or are self-taught. They started with C, or PHP, or Python, or JavaScript. Different descriptions of your product will connect with groups of the community.\n\n**Community-messaging fit is when you've found the right description of the product that connects with the majority of your community.**\n\nFinding your fit isn't a one-time process. Your product will evolve and your community will grow. You have to be constantly iterating on the right messaging.\n\n## Finding Community-Messaging Fit\n\nTwo good indicators for community-messaging fit are **virality** and **sharability**.\n\nDevelopers _want_ to share good content. When they've learned something new, or found a new way to explain a topic they're interested in, they will voluntarily amplify to their audience. When they have a “lightbulb moment”, they want to share this excitement.\n\nWhen the topic is explained clearly, and it relates back to things the developer understands, it makes it easily sharable. This is how virality happens.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`How virality happens from sharing a clear, relatable message`}\n  src={`/images/cmf/virality.png`}\n  width={2084 / 2}\n  height={802 / 2}\n/>\n\n## Examples\n\n### Next.js Middleware\n\nSince many Next.js developers have prior experience with Node.js and Express, I found that relating [Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware) to Express Middleware helped it connect better with the community.\n\nSimilar to how you can “stack” Express Middleware to augment parts of the routing stack, the Next.js Middleware function can be composed from a `Request` and eventually produce a `Response`.\n\nI've now landed on: Middleware gives you complete control over routing in Next.js. This description can be dialed up or down depending on the audience.\n\n### Edge Runtime\n\nThe first iteration of describing the [Edge Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime) was a set of APIs that works in the browser, server, and on edge computing platforms like Vercel. Unfortunately, the name “edge” is also commonly used to refer to compute or data being globally distributed at _every_ network edge.\n\nThe benefits of edge _compute_ were clear: they have no cold boots, are cost effective, and are extremely scalable. But that “edge” word still implied globally replicated. The best performance comes from co-locating your compute with your data. Feedback from the community showed that data was not usually globally replicated. So where should your “edge” compute run? Likely [regionally](https://vercel.com/blog/regional-execution-for-ultra-low-latency-rendering-at-the-edge).\n\nEdge was being used for both the _runtime_ as well as the _location_. This understanding led to an evolution of how I talked about the product. For the fastest performance, you want compute that runs close to your data, using a _light_ runtime. This light runtime is a _subset_ of Node.js APIs.\n\n## Keep on iterating\n\nCommunity-messaging fit is never finished because your community is ever-evolving.\n\nYou take the input (questions, objections) and iterate towards the new output (analogies, clarifications).

      "raw": "\nYou're applying for a new job. You submit your resume to Big Name Co™️. After glancing at it for 10 seconds, what does the hiring manager do?\n\n**They Google you.**\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Google`}\n  src={`/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/google.gif`}\n  width={1190}\n  height={108}\n/>\n\nHave you ever Googled yourself? Based on your online footprint and the uniqueness of your name, you may or may not show up on the first page. What if there was a way to improve your online presence and build your personal brand?\n\n### What Is Content Marketing?\n\nOne strategy to build your personal brand is called [content marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_marketing).\n\n> Content marketing is a form of marketing focused on creating, publishing, and distributing content for a targeted audience online.\n\nTypically, content marketing is used to attract and transform viewers into customers, but what if you're not selling anything?\n\nYou might not be explicitly selling a product, but you are **selling yourself**. You should view yourself as a business, and successful businesses usually have some form of marketing.\n\n### Why Should I Use Content Marketing?\n\nFor me personally, I learn best by _doing_. I wanted to drive more content to my portfolio, but I wasn't sure how. I decided to put more focus on creating informative, high-quality content in the form of blog posts. The results have been pretty staggering.\n\nAfter finishing my last post, [How Stripe Designs Beautiful Websites](/blog/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites), I posted a link to the article on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Article Initially Posted`}\n  src={`/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/originally-posted.png`}\n  width={1913}\n  height={589}\n/>\n\nI was immediately receiving 10x the traffic as before. The article ended up hitting #1 on Hacker News and [/r/web_design](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`#1 Reddit Article`}\n  src={`/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/reddit.png`}\n  width={1680}\n  height={184}\n/>\n\nThis ultimately led to the article being reposted across a bunch of different websites. It continued to grow organically throughout the day, bringing in ~70,000 views in 24 hours.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Article Initially Posted`}\n  src={`/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/final-views.png`}\n  width={955}\n  height={472}\n/>\n\nThis traffic created two notable events:\n\n- My average site traffic doubled\n- My portfolio moved from the 3rd page of Google to the 1st\n\nYou might be thinking \"That's great Lee, but would it work for me?\"\n\n### Who Is This For?\n\n- Are you looking for a new job?\n- Are you trying to network with your peers?\n- Do you aspire to become a [thought leader](http://randsinrepose.com/dont-skip-this/) in your industry?\n- Is your name Michael?\n\n_Just kidding_, reader named Michael who is a little freaked out right now.\n\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions, this article is for you. Let's use Michael as an example (Sorry Michael).\n\nMichael is a Computer Science graduate from a top university. During his time in college, he had a few internships with some reputable companies and managed to graduate with a 3.5 GPA. At the end of his college career, Michael [created an online portfolio](/blog/beginners-guide-to-the-programming-portfolio) to showcase his work in hopes of landing a job.\n\nLet's evaluate the market.\n\n> Who is Michael's target reader?\n\nProspective employers and fellow peers in the industry.\n\n> What are they looking for?\n\n- Examples showing he is a proficient programmer\n- High-quality content they can learn from\n- Impressive written communication skills\n\nMichael decides he wants to start a blog. His goals are to:\n\n- Effectively research and study new topics\n- Practice and exercise different skill sets\n- Develop and improve his writing abilities\n- Attract viewers that could lead to a job opportunity\n\nAsk yourself: Are you knowledgeable about something others would find value in reading? If the answer is yes, **start writing now**.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Spongebob`}\n  src={`/images/content-marketing-personal-brand/spongebob.gif`}\n  width={400}\n  height={300}\n/>\n\n### How Can I Do It?\n\nOkay, by now I've convinced you this is a good idea. But how do you actually go about _doing_ it?\n\nI'll start by addressing the most difficult part: **You have to be authentic**. You're creating an online identity for yourself. It needs to be _your_ great ideas and thoughts. You can't write some half-assed article you threw together at 2 AM and didn't proofread. You're trying to build trust with the reader.\n\nYou need to produce **high-quality content**. You can't write one paragraph and call it good. You have to provide value to your readers. So how do you produce high-quality content?\n\n1.  Research the subject matter and become very familiar with it. You should be educating your readers.\n2.  Tell stories with your articles. Make your readers connect with you.\n3.  Use humor when appropriate 😄\n4.  Include pictures. They're worth 1000 words, remember?\n5.  Optimize your article for social media. Read about [meta tags](http://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags) and [open graph](http://ogp.me/).\n6.  Don't waste their time - Make your articles concise but still informative.\n\n### Share Your Content\n\nAfter you've created some content you're proud of, you should:\n\n- Proofread it, and then proofread it again.\n- Utilize a tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to help prevent spelling issues.\n- Share it on social media and any other industry-specific communities.\n- Send emails to connect with influencers.\n- Be active and respond to readers questions and inquiries.\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\nReact attempts to be as unopinionated as possible. This is both it's greatest strength _and_ weakness.\n\nOver the years, I've tried many different ways to style my React apps. Each solution has its pros and cons.\nThis article will share my journey using CSS with React and how it's evolved to its current state. Then, I'll discuss pros/cons of\ndifferent approaches for styling.\n\n## Vanilla CSS\n\nLike most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.\n\n```html title=\"index.html\"\n<h1 class=\"header\">Welcome</h1>\n```\n\n```css title=\"index.css\"\n.header {\n  font-size: 32px;\n}\n```\n\nAs I built more large applications, I began to understand some of the drawbacks.\n\n- **Reusability.** It's easy to create append-only stylesheets that become very complex.\n- **Global Namespace.** Since CSS has a [global namespace](https://css-tricks.com/regarding-css-global-scope/), you can unintentionally target too many elements.\n- **Colocation.** It's hard to modularize your CSS, which makes it difficult to delete code safely.\n\nAt this point, I was introduced to [CSS pre-processors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_preprocessor).\nThese tools aim to introduce new funtionality and compile back to vanilla CSS.\n\n## Sass\n\n[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), one of the most popular preprocessors, allows you to write more reusable, maintainable CSS.\nSome of the most popular features are [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), and [modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules).\n\n- **Variables.** I want to define global values once and share them throughout my stylesheets.\n- **Mixins.** I want to reuse particular snippets of CSS.\n- **Modules.** I want to split up my CSS files for a more maintainable codebase.\n\n```scss title=\"_base.scss\"\n$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;\n$primary-color: #333;\n\nbody {\n  font: 100% $font-stack;\n  color: $primary-color;\n}\n```\n\n```scss title=\"_header.scss\"\n@use 'base';\n\n.header {\n  font-size: 32px;\n}\n```\n\nSass helped me write more modular, reusable CSS – at least, for a while. Over time, I ran into new issues.\n\n- **Naming.** As your CSS grows, it's easy to have class names get out of hand.\n- **Browser support.** Certain features aren't [supported across all browsers](https://caniuse.com/) and require [vendor prefixes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix) like `-moz-` (Firefox), `-webkit-` (Safari), and `-ms-` (Internet Explorer and Edge).\n\nTo solve naming, I started to adopt [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).\nBlock Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components\nand organize CSS in a modular way, which keeps specificity low.\n\n```html\n<button class=\"button\">Cancel</button>\n<button class=\"button button--primary\">Submit</button>\n```\n\n```css\n.button {\n  color: black;\n  background-color: gray;\n}\n\n.button--primary {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: green;\n}\n```\n\nNaming conventions helped but didn't fix the root cause: **naming is hard**.\nFor browser support, it's possible to set up your Sass toolchain with a tool like [autoprefixer](https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/) to handle vendor prefixes.\nHowever, around this time, I started using component-based frameworks like React. This led me to explore CSS-in-JS.\n\n## CSS-in-JS\n\nI started using CSS-in-JS when building a component library. At first, CSS-in-JS solved all my problems.\n\n- **Specificity** is solved by auto-generated class names.\n- **Colocation** is solved by putting CSS directly with the component, making it easy to delete code.\n- **Browser support** is solved by having autoprefixer built-in.\n- **Variables** are solved by creating a global theme.\n\nHowever, **naming** was still a huge pain.\n\nAs the component library grew, I began to explore [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/).\nThese were more structured approaches to scaling CSS-in-JS to help enforce a design system.\nPlus, they helped solve naming. Trying to scale [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) alone in a large application made me get _really_ creative with names.\nYou can only have so many container, wrapper, layout things. For example:\n\n```js\nconst HomeContainerWrapper = styled.div`\n   padding: 8px;\n   font-weight: bold;\n   color: white;\n   background: blue;\n`;\n\n<HomeContainerWrapper>\n  Hello\n</HomeContainerWrapper>\n\n// Forget about naming\n<Box\n  padding={3}\n  fontWeight='bold'\n  color='white'\n  bg='blue'\n>\n  Hello\n</Box>\n```\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. Inline styles 🤮. I'll admit, I wasn't sold at first. But it grew on me – and that brings us to now.\n\n## Current State\n\nI've recently been working with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).\nBoth of these approaches to styling React applications have prompted me to step back and evaluate the ecosystem.\n\nBelow, I've summarized pros and cons of various approaches to styling your React application. I tried to make this comparison as unopinionated as possible.\nThe choice that's best for you likely depends on:\n\n- Your experience (stick with what you know).\n- Your team.\n- The size of your application.\n- What you're trying to build.\n\n## Pros and Cons\n\n### Vanilla CSS\n\n<ProsCard\n  title=\"vanilla CSS\"\n  pros={[\n    `You don't want to add a toolchain. Vanilla CSS works with every browser & language.`,\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<ConsCard\n  title=\"vanilla CSS\"\n  cons={[`You're building a large web application.`]}\n/>\n\n### CSS Modules\n\n[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) would be my choice for smaller teams that don't need to share\ncomponents across applications.\n\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) has support for CSS Modules, which means you don't have to worry about setting up [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).\nIt also sets up [autoprefixer](https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/) making CSS Modules an attractive alternative to CSS-in-JS in some cases.\n\n<ProsCard\n  title=\"CSS modules\"\n  pros={[\n    'You want class names scoped to the corresponding component.',\n    'You want to use CSS variables to reuse values.',\n    'You need your application to work without JavaScript.',\n    'You want the lowest barrier to entry.',\n    'You want to use any language, not just JavaScript.',\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<ConsCard\n  title=\"CSS modules\"\n  cons={[\n    `You don't want to configure a toolchain like Webpack.`,\n    'You need to distribute a package on NPM.',\n    'You want nesting support by default (requires PostCSS).',\n    `You don't want to context switch between files.`,\n  ]}\n/>\n\n### CSS-in-JS\n\nThere's many different CSS-in-JS libraries. The two most popular are [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).\n\nThere's also zero-runtime solutions like [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), where CSS is extracted to CSS files at build-time.\nTo see comparisons between different libraries, see [CSS-in-JS benchmarks.](https://github.com/A-gambit/CSS-IN-JS-Benchmarks)\n\n<ProsCard\n  title=\"CSS-in-JS\"\n  pros={[\n    'You want to distribute as reusable components on NPM.',\n    'You want to take advantage of anything in the JavaScript ecosystem.',\n    'You want to colocate styles with components, making it easy to delete code.',\n    'You need to support multiple themes.',\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<ConsCard\n  title=\"CSS-in-JS\"\n  cons={[\n    `You don't want to configure a toolchain like Webpack.`,\n    'You are sick of figuring out names for things.',\n    'You believe it breaks separation of concerns.',\n    `You don't want to enforce all consumers must use the same CSS-in-JS solution.`,\n  ]}\n/>\n\n### Theme UI / Styled System\n\nBoth [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) and [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) abide by the [System UI theme specification](https://system-ui.com/).\nThis specification intends to help make UI components, libraries, and tools as interoperable as possible.\n\nThe primary use case for these libraries is implenting a component library and design system.\nOne of my favorite libraries is [Chakra UI](https://next.chakra-ui.com/).\n\n<ProsCard\n  title=\"Theme UI / styled-system\"\n  pros={[\n    `You're building a component library.`,\n    'You need to enforce a design system.',\n    'You want to spend less time trying to name components.',\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<ConsCard\n  title=\"Theme UI / styled-system\"\n  cons={[\n    'You dislike providing styles as props.',\n    'You believe it breaks separation of concerns.',\n  ]}\n/>\n\n### Tailwind CSS\n\n[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) has been rapidly growing in popularity. Many people are frustrated with the bloat of CSS frameworks like\n[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and want an alternative. Tailwind provides an impressive developer experience with a refined API.\n\nWith the combination of [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/), you can easily build extensible, well-designed applications.\n\n<ProsCard\n  title=\"Tailwind\"\n  pros={[\n    'You want to never leave your HTML (or JSX).',\n    'You need to enforce a design system.',\n    'You want to spend less time trying to name components.',\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<ConsCard\n  title=\"Tailwind\"\n  cons={[\n    `You don't want (potentially) long class names.`,\n    `You don't want to learn Tailwind syntax, which is slightly different than standard CSS.`,\n  ]}\n/>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI hope this article has helped demystify styling your React applications.

    "title": "What Makes a Great Developer Experience?",
    "publishedAt": "2022-06-13",
    "summary": "Tools that keep developers in the flow state have a magnetic force. An often unexplainable, invisible pull that attracts and retains them to certain products. This pull is Developer Experience (DX).",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nHere's a collection of opinions I hold on what makes a great Developer Experience (DX). Note that some of these apply more broadly than their category (e.g. frameworks).\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1476237583105601538\" />\n\n### Frameworks and Libraries\n\n- **Onboard as fast as possible:** To keep creatives in the flow, you want to enable them to get started as quickly as possible. Try to ensure frameworks and libraries optimize for getting started quickly. For example, `npx create-next-app` or `brew install bat`. Optimize for quick iterations and fast feedback loops to the developer.\n- **Make upgrading easy:** When making a major version change, limit the “blast radius” of the changes to make it easy for folks to update dependencies. Ideally, changes should start out opt-in with many months of lead time before landing in a major version. Then, major versions should include codemods – scripts that run code transforms to help automatically migrate code and fix breaking changes.\n- **Helpful error messages:** When applicable, include hyperlinks in error messages to provide more context on how to solve the error. Your tools should be providing you feedback as you type. The faster, the better (e.g. type checking, linting) before runtime or compilation errors. [Don't make me think](https://www.swyx.io/write-errors-that-don-t-make-me-think-24hg).\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1124787522909949952\" />\n\n- **Strong defaults and conventions:** Have an opinion about “the right way” to build software. For example, don't make me think about setting up routing, just use the file-system-based routing with Next.js. Don't make me configure compilation and bundling, just set up good defaults for me with webpack/swc/vite/esbuild.\n- **Provide escape hatches:** The counter to strong defaults is to make sure there are escape hatches when the developer wants to break from the standard configuration. One reason Next.js was successful in the beginning was being able to easily override webpack _without_ leaving the framework, whereas CRA required something like [craco](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco) after ejecting.\n- **Reduce risk with dependencies:** When you `npm i next`, you only install 13 dependencies from npm. The rest of the dependencies are inlined into Next.js to have faster installation times and improved security. In the future, we'd like to turn Next.js into a [single binary](/blog/rust) you can install.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Lead with code:** Developers want to write code. Give them code examples as starting blocks. Don't bury the lede.\n- **Solve the problem (aka: answer the question):** Developers come to docs to learn the answer to a question, challenge, or problem they're trying to resolve. Give them the answer through multiple methods (video, text, tutorials, guides, etc.), so they learn the solution in a way that works for them.\n- **Automated documentation:** When documenting an API, it's helpful to generate the docs from the source of truth (code) to ensure they remain in sync. For example, Vercel's API docs are auto-generated from its [OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/).\n- **Not just the happy path:** The documentation is a reference guide for developers trying to get work done. Often, this means searching for an error and looking for a solution they can copy/paste. It's important to document the workaround and hacks, too. I'd rather acknowledge a gap in the product and _unblock_ the developer rather than leave them frustrated.\n- **Optimize for skimming:** Let's face it, we all skim. Especially when reading developer documentation. My eyes jump directly to code blocks, trying to find the solution to my given problem. To help provide the best DX, consider adding helpful code comments in the code snippets and showing multiple options or permutations of the desired feature/API.\n- **Be precise:** Avoid technical jargon and idioms. If you're using an acronym, spell it out the first time and don't assume the reader knows what it is. Your docs should be accessible for both beginners and experts. Consider putting content that's helpful for experts but not critical for the happy path in collapsible “deep dive” sections.\n- **Progressively expose complexity:** Keep the first-time experience crisp while progressively informing developers about more complex features as they continue building with the product. It's not feasible to expect developers to learn about the entirety of the platform to get started.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1258579119740248066\" />\n\n### APIs\n\n- **Don't break API workflows:** API versioning should be very intentional and explicit. Err on the side of over-communication when making changes to APIs and give developers plenty of time to update to new versions. I've personally enjoyed Stripe's API versioning – they have [an excellent post](https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning) if you want to learn more. I've seen some instances where AWS sends a deprecation email about an API that's been stable for years, plus gives them years of upgrade time.\n- **Let me try out APIs quickly:** Some of my favorite API documentation allows you to generate an API key and try out endpoints in a few seconds. Some even recognize that you're already logged in and personalize the page based on your account information. [Square does this well](https://developer.squareup.com/explorer/square). I also like GraphiQL for this – you view the entire graph schema, make requests, run mutations, format your code, and more.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1471351025252519936\" />\n\n## Related Reading\n\n- [The Case for Developer Experience](https://future.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/)\n- [The Radiating Circles of DX Architecture](https://dx.tips/circles)\n- [What Is Developer Experience? - Adam Wathan (Tailwind CSS) and Lee Robinson (Vercel)](https://developerexperience.buzzsprout.com/1806381/8744993)\n- [What is Experience Engineering?](https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/)\n",

They do have differences depending on the company, so I'll start with how I personally view DevRel.\n\nTo me, DevRel is helping **educate developers** and **grow our community**. There are pillars of DevRel that everyone on the team shares ownership for, like developer experience, quality control, and excellence in communication.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1508908852330340370\" />\n\nPart of the reason DevRel teams are ran so differently depends on the type of company and industry. So, let's narrow down this post even further: **Developer Relations at DevTools or developer-led companies.**\n\n## What is DevRel like at Vercel?\n\n**DevRel is an integral part of everything we do at Vercel.** We care deeply about developers and their experience using our platform and tooling.\n\nIt starts from [Guillermo](https://twitter.com/rauchg) (our CEO) and works it's way down. Great DevRel teams stem from founders who empathize with developer pain. You'll often see `@rauchg` replying to folks on Twitter, asking for feedback on the product or helping customers succeed. He leads by example for the entire DevRel team to follow.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1396320966934859780\" />\n\nSince DevRel is such a public facing role, the DevRel team represents the ethos of the company. When we host an event, create a video, meet with a customer, or any other interaction – it should _scream_ Vercel. I believe this comes from being a company that **leads with design**.\n\nDesign is user experience _and_ developer experience. It's the DNA of what makes Vercel successful. Everyone at Vercel sweats the details to provide an exceptional experience for customers. We're very blessed with some incredible designers who I've been able to shadow and learn from, helping me (and the rest of the DevRel team) lead with design in _everything_ we do.\n\nOne of my goals is to create a positive, uplifting, and vibrant community of developers who are excited about making the web faster. This means you'll find me or others on the team in GitHub, Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Facebook, Hacker News, and everywhere else online learning about how developers use our products and where we can improve.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1517249071702024193\" />\n\nIn the process of educating developers about the tools and products we provide, we learn what is working well and what's not. Our team then is able to work with product to relay valuable customer insights so we can iterate towards the best customer experience.\n\n## Is DevRel right for me?\n\nI truly believe the demand for DevRel (and content creation in general) is only going to continue increasing at a rapid pace. But I think it's also important to stress you don't _need_ to quit your job to validate if DevRel is right for you.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1383873047619276812\" />\n\nYou can start creating content today – it's permissionless. No one is stopping you from writing that blog post, creating that video, or teaching others about tech you find interesting. While it's definitely easier to transition from an existing developer/programmer/engineer into DevRel, it's possible to start with DevRel as your first role.\n\nLet's assume you're looking to move into DevRel from engineering, which is the most common path. Here are some questions to ask yourself, along with my own responses that led me to switch to DevRel.\n\n> Are you finding your engineering work fulfilling?\n\nI felt limited, wanting to do more than just code. I knew my experience and skills in writing, design, and video creation could be better utilized. I'd actually had design teams shut down my suggestions to help improve the user experience of the product before.\n\n> If you need to write a one or two-page document outlining an architecture design for a feature you're working on, does that sound fun or dreadful?\n\nYes. I love writing. Especially clearly articulating tradeoffs for architecture decisions. If we do this, what are the pros? Cons? How does it impact our product in 6 months? 1 year?\n\n> Do you enjoy staying up to date with the latest tools and libraries in your space?\n\nYes. I love to learn and experiment with new tech. It helps programming feel fresh to me. To be a developer is to be a lifelong learner.\n\n> Do you like to work across teams? Do you enjoy communicating with marketing and product?\n\nYes. I have an entrepreneurial heart and love seeing and being involved with all parts of how the business runs.\n\n> Are you the type of person who enjoys debates? Can you articulate your points clearly?\n\nIt's a skill I've developed over time. Having empathy for other developers and being able to understand their situation and constraints is key.\n\n## Will I stop developing if I move to DevRel?\n\nNo, you should continue coding. You can't lose sight of the “developer” part of Developer Relations. To understand and empathize with developers, you need to put yourself in their shoes. Especially if you're advocating for a product developers use.\n\nFor example, let's assume you're advocating for a database. You might start to get questions like:\n\n- How does this database compare against [competitor]?\n- When would I use [feature] over [feature]?\n- What's the best way to build an [industry-specific] app using this database?\n- How should I model my data to stay within the free tier?\n\nIt's going to be hard to accurately answer these questions if you don't have hands-on experience developing using the product. You should be the first user of beta features and the first to provide feedback to the product team on what's going well (and maybe not so well).\n\n## Growing DevRel Teams\n\nHigh trust teams are [high growth teams](/blog/hypergrowth). I want to create a team that trusts each other, has autonomy to get their work done, and is given ownership over some part of the experience.\n\nFor example, on my team each member has a specific area of focus and ownership. This helps them have a north star for the type of content they're creating, and also allows them to get invested in that segment of the community.\n\nI have a few non-negotiables in terms of how DevRel teams should be ran:\n\n1. It doesn't matter if DevRel reports to marketing, product, engineering, or directly to the CEO. What matter is how the team is given ownership, autonomy, and what metrics [quantify their success](https://www.swyx.io/measuring-devrel).\n2. DevRel teams represent the company, but they are also individuals, often with their own following or areas of interest. It's the wrong approach to try and box creatives into company/team structures of the past. The new age of developer creatives are more like professional knowledge athletes, where they represent companies or teams but also have their own independent initiatives.\n3. The company does not control your social media accounts. You should never be forced to tweet/share something on behalf of the company from your personal account. Many advocates have worked hard to create an audience that finds their work valuable, and shouldn't be pressured to dilute that. I've heard some horror stories about this and feel pretty strongly about it. You should be creating content or products _so good_ that advocates _want_ to talk about them.\n4. You can always, _always_ learn something from your customers. Even when they're complaining on Twitter or upset in GitHub issues. Leading with empathy and a genuine curiosity in how the product could be better will lead to insights others might have ignored. Engaging with upset developers can be tricky, but ultimately [rewarding if done well](/blog/handling-dev-twitter-like-rappers).\n\nIf this sounds like a team you'd want to work on, I'm hiring. While I'm open to folks looking for more general DevRel roles, I'm _very_ interested if you match these descriptions:\n\n- You're passionate about build systems, monorepos, CLIs, and making ship happen. This person would work closely with the [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) team, as well as every part of building and deploying code on the Vercel platform. You can discuss tradeoffs of how web apps are architected and love to help developers improve performance in every possible way.\n- You're passionate about the web, and the growing ecosystem of tools and companies often working together to craft incredible user experiences. You may find yourself trying out the latest database, or the new component library posted on Hacker News. You like to stitch together tools and build examples showcasing interesting open-source libraries. You can craft an impressive Notion doc. This person would work closely with all of our technology partners, like databases, content platforms, ecommerce tools, and more.\n\nThat's all for now. Drop me an email at `lee@vercel.com` with three paragraphs on why you'd be a good fit if you're interested in joining.\n",

      "raw": "\nDevelopers want to be productive – but are often slowed down by the complexity of their tools.\n\nTools that keep developers in the flow state have a magnetic force. An often unexplainable, invisible pull that attracts and retains them to certain products. This pull is developer experience (DX).\n\nDX, like magnetic forces, either attract or repel. Products with a great developer experience are invaluable to a developer's workflow. I've used hundreds of devtools in my career. The products that kept me in the flow state stuck around. Vercel was one of those products for me, which is why I joined the team.\n\n**It's an honor to share that I am now the VP of Developer Experience at Vercel** to continue to invest in the foundations of DX and community as a core part of the company strategy. This post outlines why my role is expanding beyond DevRel and why Developer Experience is now part of the executive team.\n\n## Investing in DX\n\nDX isn't just important for customers – it's also critical for product-led growth. Providing a [world-class developer experience](/blog/developer-experience-examples) for our products and tools has led to hypergrowth:\n\n- **The future is Edge first:** By enabling developers to `git push` and receive a global application in seconds, Vercel is now serving over 25B requests per week at the Edge and steadily growing. New Edge computing primitives are taking this further, like [server-rendering SvelteKit](https://sveltekit-on-the-edge.vercel.app/) from an Edge Function.\n- **Empowering the frontend developer:** Whether it's ~40k developers in the Next.js Discord community or [hyper-local groups](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1531695305766445056) of 40 JavaScript developers, we're helping educate and enable the next generation of developers.\n- **Frameworks enable the developer:** We created Next.js to simplify the process of creating server-rendered React applications. By investing in the developer experience of the _framework_, and enabling developers to quickly build optimized React sites, we've seen Next.js grow to 2.7M downloads per week (and [more GitHub stars](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) than Node.js / Kubernetes 🤯).\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1489309802417246212\" />\n\n## DX at Vercel\n\nA great developer experience requires empathy for the day-to-day challenges of building software.\n\nAt Vercel, Developer Experience is a _superset_ of [Developer Relations](/blog/devrel-at-vercel) (which is focused on building community and advocating for the product) and Documentation.\n\nOur organization has four DX pillars:\n\n- **Education:** Enable developers of all experience levels to build on the web and master their craft.\n- **Documentation:** Provide clear reference materials for using our products and unblock developers to complete their desired tasks.\n- **Community:** Foster a frontend developer community that can build and learn together through meetups, conferences, and online communities.\n- **Templates:** Make it easier to get started building with our tools while focusing on performance, accessibility, and design.\n\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\n\nEngineering organizations can also have _internal_ developer experience (or [developer productivity](https://www.airbnb.com/careers/departments/engineering/dev_infra)) teams. They make tests more reliable, build shared tooling, improve build performance, and help teams get code shipped faster.\n\n</Callout>\n\nMy team has four operating principles that help us [build a great developer experience](/blog/developer-experience-examples):\n\n- **Increase exposure hours:** We can understand if developers are struggling with our product by [increasing our exposure hours](https://articles.uie.com/user_exposure_hours/#:~:text=Exposure%20hours.,the%20designs%20that%20team%20produces). We talk to developers, watch their videos or read their articles, and even sometimes join their live streams.\n- **Learn by building:** We should use our product and be alpha testers for new features. Not only does this help us create educational content, it also surfaces product feedback and areas for improvement.\n- **Empathy first:** We want to enable any developer to build quality software, and that requires understanding their day-to-day challenges. Having empathy for both beginners and experienced developers is critical.\n- **Hell yeah or no:** If you're not feeling “[hell yeah!](https://sive.rs/hyn)” then say no. This helps us focus on the most important work that is aligned with our values.\n\nWhat I love about Vercel is that every team focuses on DX. Our team is ensuring the **end-to-end developer experience** of the platform.\n\n## A New Vision for DevRel\n\nDevRel as we knew it is dead – and that's exciting.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1105985400110112768\" />\n\nIn the past, Developer Advocates might have traveled around the world speaking at conferences, spending months preparing and rehearsing for their talks. The last few years flipped DevRel on its head as travel wasn't an option anymore, and teams shifted to online conferences, live streams, and even more YouTube videos.\n\nNow in 2022, we've started to return back to in-person conferences. But all this time away has changed the rules of the DevRel game. **The power now lies with the content creators.**\n\nHyper global and _hyper local_ is the future of advocacy. Conferences can still be incredibly powerful for connecting with a global community, but they have to be online-first. The quality of the online event should be as good as in-person. In my opinion, DevRel teams should be saying no to more conference talks. They should focus on the _highest impact_ talks that are hyper global, cut out the cruft in the middle, and double down on local meetups to engage and educate smaller communities.\n\nDevRel in service of a better DX has to be the priority.\n\n## Thank You\n\nI've been at Vercel for almost two years now. And I'm more excited than ever about our team, our product, and our wonderful community.\n\nA sincere thank you to everyone at Vercel who has helped me grow along this journey – as well as everyone in the larger Next.js and Vercel community for always providing feedback about our tools, jumping on calls with me to talk about what we can improve, and showing up to our meetups and conferences.\n\nLet's make the Web, faster.\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\nTypography accounts for [95% of web design](https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/). Your font choice can be critical for branding, readability, and performance.\n\n[Over time](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/web-fonts/), recommendations for using web fonts have changed as browsers adopted new standards. Now in 2021, I wanted to learn the best practices for using web fonts on high-performance sites.\n\n## System Fonts\n\nThe fastest way to use a web font is none. Browsers include a set of [web-safe fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Web_safe_fonts) (e.g. Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman) you can use by default.\n\nUsing web-safe fonts or the [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/) will be the fastest option.\n\n```css\nfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial,\n  sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol';\n```\n\n## Why Use Web Fonts?\n\nIf system fonts are the fastest option, why do web fonts exist? Branding, improved design, and cross browser and device consistency. [82% of web pages for desktop](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/fonts) use web fonts.\n\nLet's cover five different areas for high-performance web fonts and conclude with a 2021 recommendation.\n\n- Self Hosting\n- Preloading\n- Font Display\n- Variable Fonts\n- Subsetting\n\n## Self Hosting\n\n[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is responsible for [70% of all web font usage](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/fonts#serving-with-a-service). With over 1000 fonts, they provide easy access to quality fonts, multiple formats, and performant defaults (pre-connecting and swapping).\n\nHowever, **Google Fonts is no longer necessary**. Since 2018, [Google has advised self-hosting](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/web-performance-made-easy) for optimal performance through preloading.\n\nThere aren't any caching advantages anymore, either. Let's say you're using the font \"Roboto\", which is [a popular font](https://fonts.google.com/?sort=popularity) on Google Fonts. Chances are you've visited another site using \"Roboto\" and cached the font.\n\nSince October 2020, Chrome [no longer allows](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning) a shared cache across sites. Safari has worked this way since 2013. \"Roboto\" will be re-downloaded for every site, regardless of it being cached.\n\nWhen self-hosting, ensure you cache your font with the `Cache-Control` HTTP header. `immutable` tells the browser the file will never change. When a request is made within the `max-age` (1 year), it avoids the roundtrip to ensure it's the latest content.\n\n```bash\nCache-Control: public, immutable, max-age=31536000\n```\n\nIf you need Google Fonts, [use these optimizations](https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/). With the latest changes in the v2 API, you can tailor fonts to specific users and platforms (including variable fonts).\n\n## Preloading\n\nThe browser assigns [loading priorities](https://web.dev/prioritize-resources/) to different types of resources. By default, CSS will be loaded before scripts and images. You can influence the importance of resources by [preloading critical assets](https://web.dev/preload-critical-assets/).\n\nFonts are discovered late by the browser by default. By preloading, we fetch the font file as soon as possible. Then, the browser caches the font making it available immediately.\n\nPreloading can improve performance metrics like [Time to Interactive](https://web.dev/interactive) and [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint). For example, Shopify saw a [50% (1.2 second) improvement](https://twitter.com/ShopifyEng/status/844245243948163072) in First Contentful Paint, removing their Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT).\n\nAs of 2020, [75% of web fonts use WOFF2](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/fonts). You likely only need this. For example:\n\n```css\n<link\n\trel=\"preload\"\n\thref=\"/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2\"\n\tas=\"font\"\n\ttype=\"font/woff2\"\n\tcrossOrigin=\"anonymous\"\n/>\n```\n\n> Support: All modern browsers except Firefox.\n\n## Font Display\n\n`font-display` allows you to modify the rendering behavior of web fonts with values such as `auto`, `swap`, `block`, `fallback` and `optional`. When loading web fonts, we want to prevent [layout shift](https://web.dev/cls/). This occurs in two ways:\n\n- Flash of Unstyled Text (FOUT) — The fallback font is swapped with a new font (e.g. `swap`).\n- Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) — Invisible text is shown on the page until a new font is rendered (e.g. `block`).\n\nBrowsers currently have a default strategy similar to `block`. The only option that eliminates layout shift is `optional`. Combined with the other performance optimizations in this article, `optional` is your best choice.\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Inter';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-display: optional;\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\n}\n```\n\n> Support: All modern browsers\n\n## Variable Fonts\n\n[Variable fonts](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/) allow us to combine multiple styles and weights (e.g. bold, italic) into a single font file.\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Inter';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 100 900; // Range of weights supported\n  font-display: optional;\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\n}\n```\n\nYou can try out different variable font options [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide).\n\n> Support: All modern browsers. Even Google Fonts v2 API has support for variable fonts.\n\n## Subsettings\n\nFont files contain multiple languages and glyphs, which increase the file size. Subsetting is the removal of characters you don’t need.\n\nFor example, we might use the Inter variable font and subset to latin languages.\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Inter';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 100 900; // Range of weights supported\n  font-display: optional;\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\n  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA,\n    U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215,\n    U+FEFF, U+FFFD;\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\n1.

      "raw": "\nYou want to start creating videos for developers but are unsure where to start. It seems daunting – what equipment do I need? How do I edit videos? How do I make them good quality? How do I distribute them?\n\nThis guide will teach you everything you need to know to start creating videos for a technical audience. It will explain the fundamentals behind video production and explain the terms you need to know. It will show you how to have excellent video quality in your home studio.\n\nI create videos for my job (in Developer Relations) and have worked as a freelance videographer in the past. This multi-part guide will share tips I've learned over years of creating videos and also include a purchasing guide to save you time. I've done the research, and have different recommendations based on your price range.\n\n- **Part 1: Fundamentals of Video**\n- Part 2: Video Equipment & Purchasing Guide\n- Part 3: Shooting Videos & Screencasts\n- Part 3: Editing & Distributing\n\n## Why Video?\n\nVideo is quickly becoming the most common way people consume content. With the global adoption of smartphones higher than ever ([80% of the total population in some countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration)) and improvements to internet speeds, it's easier than ever to stream video. That's why TikTok was one of the [most visited websites in the world](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2021/12/26/tiktok-is-now-the-most-visited-website-in-2021and-other-small-business-tech-news-this-week) in 2021.\n\n## Reusing Content\n\nCreators can reuse content in many ways and redistribute it to multiple platforms. Podcasts do this well. They shoot an hour-long video and have:\n\n- The original video version\n- Audio-only version\n- Individual clips\n\nThen, they can distribute this content in multiple ways:\n\n- Audio streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music)\n- Full video to platforms encouraging longer content (YouTube)\n- Individual clips to social media platforms\n\nWhen combined with delegating parts of the creative process (filming, editing, uploading), this can be highly effective for creators. They sit down and have four conversations with guests a month (at an hour each) and have generated 10x content for months to follow.\n\nMost videos should start with a script. A well-written script is the first step of creating an exceptional video. But you've just created another piece of content to distribute – your writing! The same script used for your video can be used for a blog post or a series of tweets.\n\n## Video Outputs & Shot Types\n\nDifferent video formats require different research, planning, scripting, and output. There are two ways to deliver video: **pre-recorded** or **live**. Live video is gaining popularity but is more challenging than pre-recoded video. For both output types, there are a few common types of shots:\n\n- **Screen recordings:** Showing your editor, terminal, or browser as you explain a topic with audio.\n- **Talking heads:** A close-up shot of your subject, where they're speaking to the camera. The term [talking head](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/talking%20head) comes from traditional media.\n- **Mobile-first:** An important separate type because it's typically filmed vertically instead of horizontally.\n\n## Fundamentals of Video\n\nLet's take a look at the terminology and concepts you'll need to understand to successfully create your first video.\n\n### Camera\n\nYou can film your videos with your phone, and it's arguably a better option for certain distribution platforms (like TikTok), but you'll want to invest in a [DSLR camera](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/dslr-camera.html) for higher quality eventually. You'll hear lots of new terms from the videography industry, so let's break down some of the most important ones.\n\nWhile some of these terms only apply to DSLR cameras, they're good to know even if you're shooting on an iPhone. In general, the goal is to end up with a shot that's not too dark and not too bright; instead, you want a shot that's _just right_, one with lots of detail.\n\n- **Aperture:** how much light is let into your camera (specifically your sensor). Aperture is measured in terms of _f-stops_ (f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, etc.). Lower f-stop, more light. Higher f-stop, less light.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Aperture`}\n  src={`/images/video/aperture.png`}\n  width={1422}\n  height={556}\n/>\n\n- **Exposure:** the brightness of your shot. If a shot is over-exposed, it's too bright and certain parts become “washed out”. If it's under-exposed, it's hard to make out all of the details and the footage can become grainy. Aperture affects your exposure.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Exposure`}\n  src={`/images/video/exposure.png`}\n  width={720}\n  height={480}\n/>\n\n- **Shutter speed:** the length of time the camera shutter is open while taking a photo. Aperture is measured in sections or fractions of seconds (1/125s, 1/250s, 1/500s, etc.). Shutter speed can affect exposure and the sharpness of your video. For most developer content, you'll likely have a fixed shutter speed for talking heads.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Shutter speed`}\n  src={`/images/video/shutter-speed.png`}\n  width={950}\n  height={334}\n/>\n\n- **ISO:** how sensitive your camera is to light. A higher ISO means brighter shots. ISO is measured in numbers (100, 200, 800, 1600, etc.). The goal is to keep a low ISO (100) for the best quality. For the type of content developers are producing, you can usually control your environment and lighting to allow for this to happen. Situations where you're filming and it's dark would require a higher ISO or external lighting.\n- **Frame rate:** A video is really just a bunch of pictures (frames). The frames per second, or FPS, is how we measure frame rate. Movies & TV typically use 24fps to allow for motion blur. To film slow motion, you want to have a higher fps (60fps or 120fps) to allow for additional frames when you're stretching the video out. Otherwise, the video will look choppy when slow instead of fluid.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Frame rate`}\n  src={`/images/video/motion-blur.png`}\n  width={650}\n  height={364}\n/>\n\n- **Resolution:** You've probably heard 1080p, which is HD. This is 1920 pixels wide and 1080 pixels tall, expressed as 1920x1080. There's also 4K, which confusingly has 3840x2160 for UHD and 4096x2160 for “cinema” 4K.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Resolution`}\n  src={`/images/video/resolution.png`}\n  width={745}\n  height={457}\n/>\n\n### Lens\n\nA camera is only as good as its lens. Further, different **focal lengths** affect how the image looks.\n\nThe longer the focal length of a lens, the narrow its angle of view. Subjects _appear_ larger with longer focal length lenses than they do with our eyes. Inversely, short focal lengths make subjects seem much smaller than they do to our eyes.\n\nFaces are an excellent demonstration. Long focal lengths make faces appear rounder. Shorter focal lengths make faces appear thinner and amplify features such as noses and eyes.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Focal lengths`}\n  src={`/images/video/focal-lengths.gif`}\n  width={750}\n  height={750}\n/>\n\nExtremely low focal lengths are called _ultra-wide_ (e.g. 16mm). This is now popularly known as the [GoPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro) look, although any lens at that focal length can recreate the same look. For example, 0.5x zoom on an iPhone camera is equivalent to a 13mm focal length.\n\nExtremely high focal lengths are called _telephoto_ and work best for outdoor shooting where you have plenty of space between the camera and subject.\n\nThe longer the focal length, the further away you have to place the camera from the subject, which makes filming in small spaces inconvenient. This is why most developers use a wide or ultra-wide lens for indoor shooting.\n\nDifferent camera brands have [different types of mounts](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/camera-lens-mounts-types-adapter/) (e.g. A-mount, E-mount, etc.). You need to ensure your lens mount matches your camera. For example, Sony cameras have an E-mount. You'll need to use E-mount lenses, or purchase an [adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_adapter).\n\n### Audio\n\nAudio quality is arguably more important than video quality. Why? **Bad audio quality is worse than bad video quality**. _Especially_ when doing screen recordings.\n\nThe goal when recording audio is to prevent [clipping](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)>) – when the audio is too loud and information is lost. You can always raise the volume of your recording, but you can't fix clipped audio. You prevent clipping by monitoring your audio and ensuring the level doesn't “peak”. Aim to record at -12db (decibels).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Peaks`}\n  src={`/images/video/peaks.png`}\n  width={1040}\n  height={771}\n/>\n\nIt's also important to control your environment. Have you ever seen images of artists singing in the studio? Their setup has been [acoustically treated and soundproofed](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/acoustic-treatment-101/).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Recording studio`}\n  src={`/images/video/studio.png`}\n  width={770}\n  height={436}\n/>\n\nSoundproofing is the process of making a room resistant to the passage of sound waves. You're blocking sounds from entering the room and preventing internal sounds from escaping. Certain materials, like the paneling on the wall above, absorb and trap sound waves.\n\nYou also want to prevent _[plosives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive)_ (e.g. words with the letter P) from introducing popping sounds. This can make your recording sound unprofessional. This is what [pop filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_filter) and windscreens in front of mics prevent.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Pop filter`}\n  src={`/images/video/pop-filter.png`}\n  width={1200}\n  height={800}\n/>\n\n### Lighting\n\nTo nail the professional look, you don't want to rely on natural lighting. You need a predictable, reliable way to light your subject. The most common way is to have a three-point lighting setup with a key, fill, and (hair/rim) light. I recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Sov3xmgwg) to learn more.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Lighting`}\n  src={`/images/video/lighting.png`}\n  width={640}\n  height={355}\n/>\n\nA lot of lighting comes down to artistic preference. If you want the dramatic look, maybe you only use a single key light so there are more shadows.\n\nYou will also want to _diffuse_ the light. This prevents lighting from looking harsh and unnatural, and instead better reflects natural lighting.\n\nIf you've ever seen a professional photography studio, you've likely seen lights with diffusers. They often look like umbrellas or large circular coverings on top of lights.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Photo studio`}\n  src={`/images/video/diffused.png`}\n  width={700}\n  height={393}\n/>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's a wrap on the fundamentals of video.

They're not the only ones, though. For example:\n\n- MySQL / Oracle\n- Vitess / PlanetScale\n- Terraform / HashiCorp\n- WordPress / Automattic\n- Kafka / Confluent\n- Apache Spark / Databricks\n- Laravel / Forge, Vapor, and more\n\nAnd many more.\n\n## How Vercel Funds Next.js\n\nVercel makes money from two types of customers: pay-as-you-go (swipe your credit card) and enterprise customers.\n\nMany of these customers use Next.js, the software Vercel funds maintenance and development for. Next.js is free because of these paying customers.\n\nIt's better to be open and transparent about how libraries and frameworks are funded. If your company is betting on OSS, you want some assurance that it will be maintained and actively developed.\n\nTo find the answer, work backward from the money.\n\n## Walled Gardens\n\nWouldn't this create vendor lock-in? Not exactly.\n\nDevelopers don't want walled gardens. They want the freedom to eject and self-host. It's about control. This is why all Next.js features work self-hosted. Vercel provides [infrastructure](https://vercel.com/enterprise) and a [workflow](https://vercel.com/workflow) on top of Next.js. You can [host Next.js elsewhere](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#self-hosting), if you want.\n\nI'm a fan of the model Next.js uses. It's clear how it's funded (through Vercel) and the incentive is aligned (I want to deploy Next.js at some point, maybe I will [try Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js)). It's a similar story for Svelte. You want to deploy SvelteKit, maybe you'll [try Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/svelte).\n\n## What's Next?\n\nThere are other OSS sponsorship options as well, like GitHub Sponsors, OpenCollective, Patreon, and more. I think it's fantastic this infrastructure exists and it's now easier than ever to support open-source developers.\n\nLet's see what the future brings.\n",

It stems from entrepreneurial roots. However, this desire to work across many parts of the business often came across as indecisiveness in my career.\n\nThat was three years ago – around the same time I began using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I didn't know what [Developer Relations](https://emilyfreeman.io/blog/developer-relations-more-than-the-art-of-talking-good) was at the time. However, I did know I wanted to create. I wanted to write, record, stream, post, tweet, and grow a community. I wanted to help others learn and progress in their careers. This realization led to me becoming a creator and helping others learn to program.\n\nAfter teaching over 100,000 developers from around the world, I joined the team at Vercel.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1303849673141243905\" />\n\n## It’s all about community. In realtime.\n\nAt Vercel, we're [relentlessly focused](https://rauchg.com/2020/next-for-vercel#frontend-focus) on improving the Developer Experience of building for the web. This means changes like making `next dev` [start 24% faster](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-2), refreshing changes [200ms quicker](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-1), and including [zero-config solutions](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10) to improve performance.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1387420270646943746\" />\n\nWe want to make development a [collaborative, real-time experience](https://twitter.com/shuding_/status/1378086219708473344) accessible to everyone. By providing close integrations to your [database](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1351576575888797696), CMS, or other services, we aim to make it as easy as possible to build modern web apps.\n\nNext.js is growing quickly with over [1.3 million installations per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next). Recent releases [10.0](http://nextjs.org/10), [10.1](https://nextjs.org/10-1), and [10.2](https://nextjs.org/10-2) have added features to help improve performance, while simplifying and speeding up the development process. **But we're just getting started.**\n\nYesterday, we announced a special edition of [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf) on June 15th, where we'll be unveiling some new features you don't want to miss. If you were one of the 40,000 attendees last year, you'll have the option to select an exclusive silver ticket. There's also one more VIP gold ticket which I won't explain just yet 🤐\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1394749422194528263\" />\n\n## Join Me\n\nI'm equally excited to announce we're growing our team with three roles:\n\n- [Developer Advocate](https://vercel.com/careers) – Educate on the latest Next.js features, craft high-quality examples and demos, engage with our community, write documentation, and advocate for a faster web. This role will work closely with myself, Marketing, Product, and our CEO.\n- [Field Engineer / Solutions Architect](https://vercel.com/careers) – Work with our sales team to provide solutions to customer's needs. You have a deep understanding of building large-scale applications, understanding technical requirements, and discussing tradeoffs. USA only (UTC −4 to -8). This was my previous role, highly recommended. Send me a message if you want to learn more.\n- [Community Manager](https://vercel.com/careers) – Engage our community across platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Discord, StackOverflow, and more! Ensure our user's needs are met and help gather customer feedback.\n\nI’m the most energized and optimistic I’ve ever been in my 10 years as a developer. We're building a truly world-class team of folks at Vercel. If you want to join a high-growth startup, scale a community with millions of developers, and transform the way we build the web – join me!\n\nThank you to everyone who has supported me. To say I am humbled and grateful would be an understatement. I'd also like to thank the 1,500+ open-source contributors and the incredible work of the Next.js core team, as well as our partners on the Google Chrome team and the React team at Facebook for helping improve Next.js.\n\nFinally, I want to thank [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevinvangundy) and [Hank](https://twitter.com/thehanktaylor) for helping me grow in my role at Vercel – and [Guillermo](https://twitter.com/rauchg) for steering the ship with impressive attention to detail and quality.\n",

    "title": "The Story of Heroku",
    "publishedAt": "2022-05-30",
    "summary": "How Heroku changed how we build and deploy software.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nHeroku made it easy for any developer to build and run applications in the cloud without managing their own infrastructure. Now 15 years later, it continues to inspire the next generation of developers. Why did Heroku become so popular? What can we learn from their incredible developer experience? How is Heroku shaping the next generation of serverless?\n\n## Early Days of Heroku\n\nIn 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) [launched EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/), making it easy to run compute on-demand. Developers didn't need to purchase, set up, and manage their own infrastructure anymore – they could pay for cloud compute as needed.\n\nAt the same time, many developers were building monolithic [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) applications. Rails made developers incredibly productive at building applications, but it was still painful and time-consuming to get them deployed. Developers might spend weeks (or months) just on deployment.\n\nIn 2007, three Ruby developers – James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, and Orion Henry – founded Heroku. Their mission was to make computing more accessible. The [first version of Heroku](https://techcrunch.com/2008/02/07/heroku-lifts-ruby-on-rails-development-to-the-cloud/) was an in-browser code editor that made it easy to build and deploy Ruby applications.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Heroku's original product, an in-browser IDE allowing you to instantly create and publish Rails apps.\"\n  src={`/images/heroku/ide.png`}\n  width={833}\n  height={623}\n/>\n\nWhile their original goal was to help educate developers and make computing more accessible, they noticed that many developers weren't using the platform for _learning_ – they were using it as an easy way to get their Ruby applications deployed. Heroku joined Y Combinator to become the easiest place to build and deploy any Rails application.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Early version of Heroku from 2008, soon after joining Y Combinator.\"\n  src={`/images/heroku/2008.png`}\n  width={3014 / 2}\n  height={1586 / 2}\n/>\n\nShortly after Heroku launched, Google App Engine (2008) and Microsoft Azure (2010) entered the market. A trend started to appear. Developers wanted to spend less time configuring infrastructure, and more time building their application.\n\nIn 2010, Heroku was bought by Salesforce for [$212 million](https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/breaking-salesforce-buys-heroku-for-212-million-in-cash/). At the time of acquisition, Heroku had ~30 employees and only supported Ruby. Y Combinator was still relatively unproven and Heroku was their [largest exit yet](https://www.ycdb.co/top-companies/exit-value).\n\nWhat did Salesforce see in Heroku that led to acquisition?\n\n## Early Bets\n\nHeroku made some early tech choices that proved to be very productive for developers building monolithic applications: **Ruby on Rails, Git, and Postgres.**\n\nGit was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds to help develop Linux. Even though there were many version control systems at the time, git begun to slowly grow in popularity. However, everything changed when GitHub was founded in 2007.\n\nLike the Heroku founders, the GitHub founders were Ruby developers. In 2008, the Ruby on Rails project switched to using GitHub, and the entire Ruby community followed shortly after (thus adopting git as well). **Heroku became synonymous with Rails.** Later, the creator of Ruby [joined Heroku](https://blog.heroku.com/matz_joins_heroku) to continue working on the language.\n\nTo run your Rails application, you needed a database. Heroku allowed you to add a Postgres database with **one click** through [add-ons](https://elements.heroku.com/addons). Today, Postgres has grown to be one of the most popular databases, which wasn't as obvious in 2008. It became the default choice for folks building monolithic Rails applications.\n\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\n\nAdam, the Co-Founder and CTO of Heroku, coined the term [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/). This was the blueprint for building for the web (at the time) and is still relevant many years later.\n\n</Callout>\n\n## Developer Productivity\n\nHeroku set a new standard for developer experience. To deploy your application, you pushed code to git and received a URL. `git push heroku main`. **That's it.**\n\nHeroku would build your application remotely (in the cloud) and deploy it to their infrastructure. Developers weren't used to deployment being this easy or fast. Heroku was ahead of its time and “serverless” in the sense you didn't have to manage servers yourself.\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Heroku's landing page in 2011 after expanding past Ruby to become a cloud application platform\"\n  src={`/images/heroku/2011.png`}\n  width={3010 / 2}\n  height={1582 / 2}\n/>\n\nDevelopers were able to delegate hosting to the Heroku platform without feeling like they were giving up too much control. They didn't _want_ to manage server maintenance or perform upgrades – but they did want to understand what was happening if things went wrong.\n\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\n\nHeroku's [Buildpacks](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks) have shaped how software is built today. They automated the build process for any language or framework and transformed the code you write into a deployable image on Heroku. You might hear similar terminology today as “builders” or “adapters”.\n\n</Callout>\n\nAs their Co-Founder James said, you “[dialed up the knob when you wanted to scale up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FhcROr0XdM)”. Heroku nailed the CLI experience with commands like:\n\n- `heroku logs` - View realtime logs from your application\n- `heroku run` - Execute any shell command on the remote machine\n- `heroku ps` - View the status of remote processes running\n- `heroku config:add key=value` - Add environment variables to configure your app\n- `heroku rollback` - Single command rollback to an existing working version\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Heroku's landing page in 2011 after expanding past Ruby to become a cloud application platform\"\n  src={`/images/heroku/platform.png`}\n  width={1141}\n  height={602}\n/>\n\n## Heroku's Platform Dominance\n\nHeroku became one of the largest platforms for building and deploying code by providing:\n\n- Hosting for your app\n- One-click button to add a database (including backups)\n- One-click resizing/scaling of services\n- Support for background jobs\n- Add-ons for monitoring, logging, and more\n\nDevelopers didn't need to manually configure services to get started. They just pushed code through git. And while Heroku was opinionated about it's preferred stack (Rails + Postgres), it had a wide ecosystems of add-ons if you had different preferences.\n\nThe seamless integration between the framework of choice (Ruby on Rails) and the infrastructure made developers incredibly productive. Developers could deploy a monolithic Rails app to Heroku in a weekend and dial up the knobs as their traffic increased.\n\nHeroku became a focal point of education for anyone working with Rails and Node.js due to its free tier. Hobby developers and students could turn their ideas into production code extremely fast, without needing access to a credit card.\n\n## From Monolith to Microservices\n\nDuring Heroku's rise to dominance, some developers began to scale out of monolithic workloads. This was expedited by two trends: **serverless** and **Kubernetes**.\n\n- **2013:** Docker is released\n- **2014:** Kubernetes is released\n- **2014:** AWS Lambda is released\n- **2017:** GitHub moves to Kubernetes\n\n<Image\n  alt=\"Serverless and Kurbernetes trends on Google\"\n  src={`/images/heroku/trends.png`}\n  width={2360 / 2}\n  height={1254 / 2}\n/>\n\nDuring this same time period, the types of web experiences developers were trying to build demanded more specialized tools. There was an unbundling of the monolithic into dedicated, specialized services:\n\n| Monolith (on a single server) | Microservices (APIs & libraries)                                 |\n| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Authentication                | Auth0, AWS Cognito                                               |\n| Database Queries              | Prisma, Mongoose                                                 |\n| Compute                       | AWS Lambda, Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers |\n| HTML Rendering & Templates    | Frontend Frameworks                                              |\n| JavaScript and CSS Bundling   | Frontend Frameworks                                              |\n| Realtime                      | Firebase, Ably, Pusher, AWS SQS, etc.                            |\n| Storage                       | AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage                                     |\n| Image Optimization            | Imgix, Cloudinary, AWS CloudFront                                |\n\nAt the time, monolithic apps were still the fastest way for developers to put an idea into production. This new wave of serverless and Kubernetes was often difficult to use and required specialized talent. Some teams jumped on the new trend too quickly, where it was often cheaper to scale up and pay for a managed platform like Heroku than to hire a team of DevOps engineers.\n\nHowever, some developers were still ejecting from monolithic platforms due to cost, flexibility, or availability. And the state of tooling for serverless and Kubernetes left a lot to be desired. This lead to a _new wave of innovation_.\n\n## Serverless 1.0\n\nWhy did some developers start to explore moving from their monolith to serverless?\n\n- **Container size:** As the size of your application grew, so did your container – often requiring a more expensive Dyno (container) to run on Heroku. Developers wanted to break their monolith into smaller, lightweight, stateless functions. This made even more sense as code-splitting became automatic in frontend tooling like webpack (and Next.js) where you would only invoke the compute necessary for the requested route, as well as only loading the minimum required JavaScript.\n- **Difficulty scaling:** While turning up the knobs works for some applications, it's difficult to apply that approach to all apps. For example, what happens when your container has background tasks? How do you dial up the knob? Certain types of application architecture did not evolve well with monoliths. Built-in autoscaling is also [not available on all plans on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scaling#autoscaling).\n- **Issues with state:** Containers required complex health checks to understand when they were entering a bad state, often requiring restarts. This could get messy if there was initialization logic to connect to external services.\n- **Distributed visitors:** Heroku is _not_ an Edge Network and instead required you to bring your own CDN. This led some teams back to DevOps, often building their own internal version of Heroku (but with a container orchestration system like Kubernetes). Further, Heroku's limited region options meant it was a non-starter for teams with specific regulatory requirements around data storage.\n\nFor example, let's say you need to build a backend for a mobile app. Should you use a monolith or serverless? You want it to be scalable, stateless, and available around the world, all without spending too much money or time managing infrastructure.\n\n[Bret Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Taylor), the Co-CEO of Salesforce, co-creator of Google Maps, and former CTO of Facebook, was in this same position in 2019. He built an [iOS app](https://twitter.com/btaylor/status/1315312482894835712) to check the air quality and display a widget on his home screen.\n\nHe choose AWS Lambda for [on-demand compute](https://github.com/finiteloop/air-quality/blob/master/server/update_data/app.py#L53-L59), AWS S3 for [durable storage](https://github.com/finiteloop/air-quality/blob/master/server/update_data/app.py#L44-L50), and AWS CloudFront to push it to every region.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1097592089502613504\" />\n\nBut to \"beat\" Heroku, you needed to be 10x better. And Serverless 1.0 was not 10x better.\n\n## Heroku in 2022\n\nHeroku has had a tough 2022 with multiple [security incidents](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2413) and ongoing [outages](https://status.heroku.com/incidents/2402). This has led some teams who might have skipped the Serverless 1.0 era step back and reevaluate the current state. How are teams building today?\n\nHeroku's favorite framework – Ruby on Rails – is now hosted on GitHub Pages. None of the 15 Rails companies featured on the home page are using Heroku for their .com (as far as I can tell). Even the biggest Rails shop, GitHub, has started [building with React](https://primer.style/react/) on the frontend and moving the [backend to Kubernetes](https://www.theregister.com/2018/08/16/github_rails_microsoft/#:~:text=The%20company%20is%20moving%20away,Haskell%20being%20deployed%20for%20services).\n\nWhat developers loved about Heroku was that they **didn't have to manage infrastructure**. Somewhere along the way from monolith to microservices, application developers ended up doing DevOps again. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), and [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) enabled a more lean DevOps experience, but still required managing, scaling, and debugging that infrastructure.\n\nExpectations for both frontend and backend experience have risen, making some developers abandon PaaS for a decoupled architecture allowing them to pick the best tools possible.\n\n## What can we learn from Heroku?\n\nI'm personally inspired by Heroku and have used the platform since 2012 for some side projects. We can learn a lot from their story and how it's shaped the software industry.\n\n- **Git push to URL is incredibly powerful:** When folks talk about Heroku 15 years later, they still mention `git push heroku main`. Heroku inspired platforms like Vercel with one command (`vercel`) to deploy your frontend globally, while having a singular remote (origin) and creating deeper integrations into first-party git providers (e.g. GitHub).\n- **Editing code in browser lowers the barrier to entry:** While Heroku pivoted away from an in-browser IDE, their ideas have led (either directly or indirectly) to the creation of Codepen, CodeSandbox, GitHub CodeSpaces, Replit, StackBlitz, and more.\n- **Don't forget about solo developer productivity:** Some developers still deploy monolithic applications to Heroku or other services like Fly.io, Railway, and Render to colocate their backend and frontend. They don't need (or want) to have microservices.\n- **Platforms need to evolve over time:** You could make the argument Heroku would be even more popular today if it evolved to add support for scaling to zero, global deployments by default, and focused on the rapidly evolving JavaScript/TypeScript/React ecosystem.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1334595810240106497\" />\n\nI'm also biased, as I work at Vercel, in believing serverless and Edge platforms are the future. Here's my thoughts on where we're headed:\n\n- On the **frontend**, you want to `git push` and have your code close to your visitors globally. Platforms like Vercel help you go from idea to global app in seconds.\n- On the **backend**, you (probably) don't want to scale Kubernetes yourself. There's now fully-managed Kubernetes ([AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Google Cloud GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)), as well as [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run), which allows you to run and automatically scale stateless serverless containers.\n- **Serverless functions** don't need [health checks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/production-check#dyno-redundancy) and are [highly available (multi-az)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/security-resilience.html) without having to think about \"[number of dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/production-check#dyno-redundancy)\". For each concurrent request, you get a function instance. Scaling is not something you spend time tuning or thinking much about. Entire categories of commands like `ps:stop`, `ps:restart`, and `ps:scale` disapper and become unnecessary.\n\nAnd that's all for now. Hopefully you now have a better appreciation how Heroku changed the software industry.

Stripe is a company that allows people and businesses to accept payments online and in mobile apps. That doesn't sound like a company that would have an exquisite website design, but look at how Stripe describes themselves on their about page.\n\n> \"We think that building an internet business is a problem rooted in code and design, not finance.\"\n\nRather than making design an afterthought, it's treated as a first-class citizen at Stripe. You can almost feel the hours of work spent iterating over designs and making minor tweaks when viewing the website's pages. In this article, I'm going to break down how Stripe creates these beautiful designs and give some tips and tricks to web designers and developers alike.\n\n### The Design\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Stripe Website`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/website.png`}\n  width={2248}\n  height={1590}\n/>\n\nPictured above is the design for Stripe's main landing page. At first glance, here's what really sticks out to me:\n\n1.  Crisp typography\n2.  Stunning color palette\n3.  High-quality images\n4.  Bold call-to-action buttons\n\nLet's start with the first observation: the font.\n\n### Typography\n\nStripe uses a font called [Camphor](https://www.fontshop.com/families/camphor). It's a modern, uncluttered, sans serif font designed by Nick Job in 2010. It _really_ shines here and looks great in a variety of weights.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Camphor Font`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/camphor.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={1114}\n/>\n\nTypography is arguably the most important part of your design since it's the medium for your content. Stripe does an excellent job of using different weights and colors to provide adequate contrast. This draws your attention to the things that matter most.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Typography Example`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/typography.png`}\n  width={1162}\n  height={944}\n/>\n\nLet's see how we can make our font as crisp and clear as possible. First, we'll define our font family to be Camphor along with some fallback fonts. **Note:** Camphor is not free and should be purchased if you're planning to use it in production. However, I did find a [gist containing the font](https://gist.github.com/bdno86/d1f49b6f533df3f832b39d6cc3194303) which you can mess around with.\n\nWe can utilize the `text-rendering` CSS property to allow us to choose quality over speed, as well as some vendor specific properties to make our font sharper. **Note:** These should work for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on Mac.\n\n```css\nbody {\n  font-family: Camphor, Open Sans, Segoe UI, sans-serif;\n  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n}\n```\n\n### Example\n\nIn this example, I apply `-webkit-font-smoothing` followed by `text-rendering`.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`CSS Example`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/css-example.gif`}\n  width={1136}\n  height={898}\n/>\n\nOkay, so we have a solid font. Let's use it on some buttons!\n\n### User Experience (UX)\n\nIndicating a visual response when hovering over items like buttons and links provides a great user experience. In the example below, you'll notice the buttons shift _slightly_ up when hovered and change colors to a lighter shade of purple. The box-shadow also becomes a bit more intense.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Buttons Example`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/buttons.gif`}\n  width={980}\n  height={288}\n/>\n\n```css\nbutton:hover {\n  color: #7795f8;\n  transform: translateY(-1px);\n  box-shadow: 0 7px 14px rgba(50, 50, 93, 0.1), 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);\n}\n```\n\nThis really makes it feel like the button is meant to be clicked. It's a wonderful experience. You can view code to recreate the buttons [here](https://codepen.io/leerob/pen/bYQRpB) on CodePen.\n\n### Color Palette\n\nI personally love the color palette of Stripe's website. It's bright and grabs your attention with some nice accent colors.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Color Palette`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/color-palette.png`}\n  width={1110}\n  height={275}\n/>\n\n### Utilizing SVGs\n\nSomething else that really stuck out to me was how high quality their images looked. This is because they use SVG ([Scalable Vector Graphic](https://svgontheweb.com/)) images instead of normal `.png` or `.jpg` files whenever possible. This has a multitude of benefits.\n\n- Smaller file sizes\n- Allows the ability to animate the image using CSS\n- Looks crisp on any size display from mobile to desktop\n\nThat tablet displayed on the home screen? Yeah, that's a `.svg` that's been scaled and rotated. Here's the `.svg` file from Stripe's website. Notice how when you zoom in the quality remains clear.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`SVG Example`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/salesforce.svg`}\n  width={420 * 2}\n  height={338 * 2}\n/>\n\n### Animations\n\nAnimations are the extra polish on top of an already beautiful design. Throughout all of Stripe's pages, you'll find a variety of animations like the ones shown below. Some are more subtle than others, but each serves a purpose.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Animation Example`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/spinning-animation.gif`}\n  width={1170}\n  height={418}\n/>\n\nHere's another example that I really like.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Another Animation Example`}\n  src={`/images/how-stripe-designs-beautiful-websites/animation-example.gif`}\n  width={2198}\n  height={358}\n/>\n\nIf you've never worked with CSS animations, I wrote a quick article showing how to [learn them by example](/blog/learning-css-animations-by-example).\n\nFor a more detailed look into creating animations, I **highly recommend** [this blog post](https://stripe.com/blog/connect-front-end-experience) by Stripe's own Benjamin De Cock breaking down the front-end experience of their product [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect).\n\n### Summary\n\nHopefully this article gave you some insight into how Stripe designs their websites and inspired you to create something of your own! Here's three main points to leave you with.\n\n- Typography choices are critical\n- Don't underestimate the value of good UX\n- Use SVG images whenever possible\n\nCheers! 🍻\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- [Stripe Elements Examples](https://stripe.github.io/elements-examples/)\n- [React Stripe Elements](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-elements)\n- [Ember Stripe Elements](https://github.com/code-corps/ember-stripe-elements)\n- [Animate+ JavaScript Library](https://github.com/bendc/AnimatePlus)\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\nYou want to print the contents of a page. If you use the standard browser API, this will print the entirety of the _current_ page.\nIn this scenario, you can use the print media query to show/hide certain parts of the page.\n\n```css\n@media print {\n  header,\n  footer {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhat if you want to print a **different page** from the current page?\n\n## Use Case\n\nLet's say you're building an e-commerce website. Users have requested they want the option to print a receipt after their purchase.\nYou don't want to mess with PDFs, so you'd like to use the web to create the structure and styling for you.\n\nAfter completing their payment, users should have the option to click a \"print receipt\" button.\nThis only loads the contents of the receipt and invokes the browser print dialog for them.\nIt should be reusable so we can reference the same receipt from their order history.\n\n## Using React & Iframes\n\nWhy do we need iframes to solve this problem?\nOur use case requires loading _only the receipt_ and nothing else. It should be available in other parts of the application as well.\n\nWe can create an `iframe` which loads the contents of our receipt. Once the content has finished loading, we can invoke the browser print API. This means it will only print what we want and allows us to reuse this component/route in other places.\n\n## Example\n\nFirst, let's create an `iframe` that routes to our receipt.\n\n```jsx\n<iframe\n  id=\"receipt\"\n  src=\"/payment/receipt\"\n  style={{ display: 'none' }}\n  title=\"Receipt\"\n/>\n```\n\nWe need to ensure the contents of that route have loaded, otherwise the page will be blank when trying to print.\nWe can communicate with the `iframe` from the receipt route to let it know we've finished loading.\n\n```js\nparent.postMessage({ action: 'receipt-loaded' });\n```\n\nFinally, we need a way to invoke the print dialog.\nLet's create a component which sets up an event listener for the `receipt-loaded` message from the `iframe` receipt route.\nWhen the route has finished loading, we can click the `button`.\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction PaymentConfirmation() {\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  const handleMessage = (event) => {\n    if (event.data.action === 'receipt-loaded') {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  const printIframe = (id) => {\n    const iframe = document.frames\n      ? document.frames[id]\n      : document.getElementById(id);\n    const iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow || iframe;\n\n    iframe.focus();\n    iframeWindow.print();\n\n    return false;\n  };\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    window.addEventListener('message', handleMessage);\n\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener('message', handleMessage);\n    };\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <iframe\n        id=\"receipt\"\n        src=\"/payment/receipt\"\n        style={{ display: 'none' }}\n        title=\"Receipt\"\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => printIframe('receipt')}>\n        {isLoading ?

      "raw": "\nToday, we announced our [$150M Series D](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-funding-series-d-and-valuation) at a $2.5B valuation. I joined Vercel a year and a half ago. Before Vercel, I'd never worked at a hypergrowth company. When you're in an environment with exponential company growth, you're also likely to have exponential _personal_ growth.\n\nTo visualize growth, here's a timeline of my work at Vercel alongside major events:\n\n- **Apr 2020:** Vercel announces $21M Series A.\n- **June 2020:** Vercel announces first-ever Next.js global community conference.\n- **July 2020:** I started helping plan and execute the conference (part-time).\n- **Sep 2020:** I join Vercel full-time as employee #34.\n- **Oct 2020:** We host Next.js Conf with 40,000 attendees.\n- **Oct 2020:** Next.js 10 makes some waves, our biggest release yet.\n- **Oct 2020:** We launch Vercel Analytics.\n- **Dec 2020:** Vercel announces $40M Series B.\n- **Jan 2021:** Next.js crosses 1,000,000 weekly downloads.\n- **Feb 2021:** I helped close our largest ARR enterprise customer to date.\n- **Apr 2021:** I'm promoted to [Head of Developer Relations](/blog/head-of-devrel).\n- **May 2021:** I start hiring Developer Advocates for my team.\n- **June 2021:** Vercel announces $102M Series C at a $1B valuation.\n- **June 2021:** We host the special edition of Next.js Conf and announce Next.js 12.\n- **June 2021:** We announce Next.js Live.\n- **July 2021:** [Delba](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira) joins my team.\n- **July 2021:** [Steven](https://twitter.com/steventey) joins my team.\n- **Sep 2021:** [Hassan](https://twitter.com/Nutlope) joins my team.\n- **Oct 2021:** [Steph](https://twitter.com/steph_dietz_) joins my team.\n- **Oct 2021:** We host the 2nd Next.js Conf, which I helped script, record, film, and edit.\n- **Oct 2021:** We launch Vercel Checks and Edge Functions.\n- **Nov 2021:** Vercel announces $150M Series D at a $2.5B valuation.\n\nAnd that brings us to **today**:\n\n- **150+ Vercelians**, 5x larger than when I joined.\n- **30,000+ developers** in the Next.js Discord.\n- **2,000,000+ weekly downloads** for Next.js.\n- **4 Developer Advocates** on my team, growing more in 2022 👀\n- **[Incredible customers](https://vercel.com/customers)** like GitHub, McDonald's, Uber, Patreon, Facebook, and more.\n\nHere's some thoughts on my past year and a half at Vercel.\n\n### The Journey to Vercel\n\nIn 2017, I heard about this company making it simple to deploy your website. Just one command in the CLI and you're online. I remember checking out their product and feeling _connected_. This sleek, well-designed tool was for me. It helped me become a better developer and I was hooked.\n\nJoining Vercel came at the right time. I felt stagnant in my career, longing to spend more time being a creator and less time as a product engineer. I was excited by the Vercel product and even more excited about the team. So, I made the jump and joined.\n\nI joined as employee #34. I quickly got to know everyone and helped wherever possible. Hypergrowth feels like there's more water coming into the boat than you have plugs to fill the holes with. I was able to help with engineering, product, design, presales, support, you name it. I helped our customers be successful using Vercel and Next.js.\n\nAs the company grew, I was able to double down and focus on what I do best: educating developers and building developer communities. We hired more engineers, more product managers, more engineering managers, more customer success managers, etc. Our customers succeeded and grew, and we grew with them.\n\n### Growing the Developer Relations Team\n\nHiring is incredibly difficult. When I moved into leading DevRel, I knew I needed to grow a team, but first I had to create the foundation. I tried to document as much of my process and workflow as possible. In an ideal situation, I'm able to “clone” myself with my first hire. They learn the tips and tricks I use to handle my job effectively. Then, for the next hire, we have two people to help influence. And so on (thanks, [Delba](https://delba.dev/)!).\n\nFor me, the hardest part of growing a team is delegation. It's hard to give up ownership over something you've carefully crafted or implemented. It requires an immense level of trust in those you're delegating responsibility and ownership to. This comes back to hiring. Finding people I could trust, and then working to strengthen that trust, has made our team highly effective.\n\nIt's still early days for DevRel at Vercel, but I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished. Some recent highlights:\n\n- Hassan just spoke at the [Prisma Serverless Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mg2zD_DaOU&list=PLn2e1F9Rfr6lQzahh7M8NcQpYnlYBHZqe&index=5)\n- Steph just spoke at [Svelte Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCoaJBmojUE)\n- Delba created two videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYBiB6Vt9w), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB-WaTs1KHY)) for Next.js Conf and is speaking at [React Conf](https://conf.reactjs.org/)\n- Steven helped create [vercel.com/edge](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) and examples for [platforms on Vercel](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1458527553728090115)\n\n### Full-Time Remote Work\n\nI joined Vercel without having worked remotely full-time (only part-time). I was incredibly scared about missing the in-person parts of work I enjoyed: being able to work on hard problems together with someone in the same room, the easy opportunities to chat about non-work stuff and learn more about my co-workers, and the clear separation between home and work.\n\nNow, these are all solvable problems in a remote world. But they're not _easy_. Both myself and the company I work for have to be intentional about not losing the best parts about being in person. Especially with a globally distributed team.\n\nIn one of my first jobs, I'd meet up with three other people to carpool every morning. Most mornings, the _last_ thing I wanted was to make small talk in the car before work. I wanted to sleep. So, I would struggle to get 30 minutes more of sleep before going into my 8 hour day. Then, back to the carpool for the ride home. Rinse and repeat.\n\nReflecting on this, I couldn't fathom how unhealthy it sounded for me. I wanted more flexibility with my schedule. Some days, I wanted to get that extra 30 minutes of sleep and then stay an hour later. Other days, I wanted to leave as soon as possible and enjoy the nice weather. But I was bound to the shackles of the 9 to 5 and my limiting carpool. I thought about the mornings I'd get up and hit snooze for _five more minutes_. Then, I contrasted to today.\n\nToday, I wake up depending on my schedule for the day. Sometimes I'll sleep in a bit later, others I'll wake up extra early and go to the gym. When I wake up, there's no carpool. There's no 30 minutes of forced sleep and 30 minutes of small talk on the ride home. I just walk to my office in the other room. I can design my day to _best fit my life_. I can make accommodations for my life _first_ and work second. The flexibility of remote work is a privilege and one that I am thankful for every day.\n\n### What's Next?\n\nFor Vercel, we're just getting started. Earlier this month, Rich Harris joined to [work on Svelte full-time](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-welcomes-rich-harris-creator-of-svelte). Many more exciting announcements are coming in the following months. As outlined in our [Series D post](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-funding-series-d-and-valuation), we're going to use this funding to:\n\n- **Support open-source software**\n- **Make the Web Edge-first**\n- **Build the end-to-end development platform**\n- **Grow our team**\n\nI've grown more as a developer and creator in the past year and a half than in the previous five. I'm excited to keep educating and helping developers succeed with React, Svelte, or any frontend framework of their choice.\n",

    "title": "Building an Image Gallery with Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS",
    "publishedAt": "2022-03-28",
    "summary": "Learn how to create an image gallery with dynamic content from a PostgreSQL database, with support for content updates without needing to redeploy.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nThis tutorial will show you how to create a Next.js application that:\n\n- Fetches content from a PostgreSQL database (Supabase)\n- Updates content without needing to redeploy to Vercel\n- Serves optimized, blur-up images with `next/image`\n- Easily styles components with Tailwind CSS\n\nI used this to create [swag.vercel.app](https://swag.vercel.app), which is a collection of tweets from the Next.js community showing off their swag.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Example of the image gallery`}\n  src={`/images/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs/swag.png`}\n  width={2812 / 2}\n  height={2140 / 2}\n  priority\n/>\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo set up your application, we can use `create-next-app` to clone a Next.js and Tailwind CSS starter application from the official [examples directory](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss).\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss image-gallery\n```\n\nThis example includes:\n\n- The latest version of Next.js\n- Prettier configured to format code and organize Tailwind CSS class names\n- TypeScript configured for Next.js\n- Tailwind CSS configured to strip away unused class names\n- An example Next.js [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\n\n## Styling the Image Gallery\n\nNow that Tailwind is configured, we can create components to style our image gallery. Inside `pages/index.tsx`, which is the entry point into our application, let's use CSS Grid to set up the container for our images. We'll add some padding and grid spacing, which conditionally changes based on the viewport.\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nexport default function Gallery() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\n        {/* Images will go here */}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to create a component for the individual image. Not only do we want to show the image, but we also would like to show some additional metadata. In this instance, I'm adding a name and Twitter handle. Each image will also link out to the original tweet.\n\nLet's make a new component with placeholder data:\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nfunction Image() {\n  return (\n    <a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n        <img\n          alt=\"\"\n          src=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\n          className=\"group-hover:opacity-75\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\n    </a>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWe're using [group modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-parent-state) to make the hover area the _entire_ component, including the text, making the image's opacity dimmed. We're also ensuring the image maintains a 1:1 aspect ratio (square), which requires a Tailwind CSS plugin. Let's install that.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -D @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio\n```\n\nThen, we can update our `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```js title=\"tailwind.config.js\"\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio')],\n};\n```\n\n## Optimizing Images\n\nTo help achieve good [Core Web Vitals](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance), we want to optimize images. Next.js provides an [Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) that gives us:\n\n- **Faster Page Loads:** Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport\n- **Visual Stability:** Prevents [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) automatically\n- **Improved Performance:** Images use modern image formats (like WebP) for smaller file sizes and serve smaller images based on the device size\n\nLet's update our `Image` component to use `next/image`, and rename it to `BlurImage` to prevent a naming collison with the `Image` component we imported:\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport Image from 'next/image';\n\nfunction BlurImage() {\n  return (\n    <a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n        <Image\n          alt=\"\"\n          src=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\n          layout=\"fill\"\n          objectFit=\"cover\"\n          className=\"group-hover:opacity-75\"\n        />\n      </div>\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\n    </a>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWe'll use the [fill layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#layout) and `object-fit` [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) to properly scale the image.\n\nThe Next.js Image component requires an allowlist to specify which domains we can optimize images from. While we're using `bit.ly` as a placeholder, we can add any domain we want to the allowlist inside `next.config.js`:\n\n```js title=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  reactStrictMode: true,\n  images: {\n    domains: ['bit.ly'],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## Blurred Placeholders for Images\n\nWhen images are loading, we'd like to show a blurred version for a better user experience. While the Image component does include this for [local image files](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization#local-images), we're going to be retrieving images from Supabase soon. Instead, we can use `onLoadingComplete` and CSS animation + blur to achieve a similar effect.\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport Image from 'next/image';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction cn(...classes: string[]) {\n  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ');\n}\n\nfunction BlurImage() {\n  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  return (\n    <a href=\"#\" className=\"group\">\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n        <Image\n          alt=\"\"\n          src=\"https://bit.ly/placeholder-img\"\n          layout=\"fill\"\n          objectFit=\"cover\"\n          className={cn(\n            'group-hover:opacity-75 duration-700 ease-in-out',\n            isLoading\n              ? 'grayscale blur-2xl scale-110'\n              : 'grayscale-0 blur-0 scale-100'\n          )}\n          onLoadingComplete={() => setLoading(false)}\n        />\n      </div>\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">Lee Robinson</h3>\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">@leeerob</p>\n    </a>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's replace our placeholder data with real items from Supabase.\n\n## Setting Up Supabase\n\n[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) makes it really easy to create your [backend](/blog/backend), giving you a PostgreSQL database in a few clicks. Inside our Supabase dashboard, let's configure our new project:\n\n- Click \"New project\"\n- Choose your organization\n- Pick a name, database password, and click \"Create new project\"\n\nAfter your project is created, you'll want to click copy and save these two values:\n\n- **Project API keys → `service_role`:** This is how we'll securely connect to Supabase on the server.\n- **Configuration → URL:** This is the API endpoint the Supabase client will use to fetch and edit data.\n\nSave these values as [Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) inside a new file `.env.local` inside your Next.js application:\n\n```bash:.env.local\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-value-here\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-value-here\n```\n\nNext, install the Supabase client:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @supabase/supabase-js\n```\n\nFinally, we can create a new client and connect to Supabase using our environment variables:\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n\nconst supabaseAdmin = createClient(\n  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,\n  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\n);\n```\n\n## Adding Data to Supabase\n\nFirst, we will need to create a new table inside Supabase for our images.\n\n- We'll name our table `images`\n- We'll keep the `id` and `created_at` columns as is\n- Let's add `name`, `href`, `userName`, and `imageSrc` columns, which are all `text`\n- Click \"Save\" and we're done!\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Example of the image gallery`}\n  src={`/images/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs/supabase.png`}\n  width={2900 / 2}\n  height={2228 / 2}\n/>\n\nWe can add data directly through the Supabase web editor.\n\n## Fetching Data from Supabase\n\nWe've already set up our Supabase client in the file, so we can `select` all images from our `images` table:\n\n```jsx\nconst { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('images').select('*');\n```\n\nWe'll fetch this data inside `getStaticProps`. [This function](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) allows you to fetch data on the server and return it as props for the default React component exported in the Page:\n\n```tsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';\n\nconst supabaseAdmin = createClient(\n  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,\n  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\n);\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const { data } = await supabaseAdmin.from('images').select('*');\n  return {\n    props: {\n      images: data,\n    },\n  };\n}\n\ntype Image = {\n  id: number;\n  href: string;\n  imageSrc: string;\n  name: string;\n  username: string;\n};\n\nexport default function Gallery({ images }: { images: Image[] }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\n        {/* Images will go here */}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWe'll also add a type for our `Image` data returned from Supabase. Next, we can update our placeholder for images to use the real data. We'll also use our new `BlurImage` component, which makes use of `next/image` under the hood:\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nexport default function Gallery({ images }: { images: Image[] }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"max-w-2xl mx-auto py-16 px-4 sm:py-24 sm:px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:px-8\">\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-10 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-x-6 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 xl:gap-x-8\">\n        {images.map((image) => (\n          <BlurImage key={image.id} image={image} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAfter mapping through the list of `images`, we forward the current `image` as a prop to our `BlurImage` component. Let's update that component to replace the placeholder data:\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/index.tsx\"\nfunction BlurImage({ image }: { image: Image }) {\n  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n\n  return (\n    <a href={image.href} className=\"group\">\n      <div className=\"w-full aspect-w-1 aspect-h-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden xl:aspect-w-7 xl:aspect-h-8\">\n        <Image\n          alt=\"\"\n          src={image.imageSrc}\n          layout=\"fill\"\n          objectFit=\"cover\"\n          className={cn(\n            'group-hover:opacity-75 duration-700 ease-in-out',\n            isLoading\n              ? 'grayscale blur-2xl scale-110'\n              : 'grayscale-0 blur-0 scale-100'\n          )}\n          onLoadingComplete={() => setLoading(false)}\n        />\n      </div>\n      <h3 className=\"mt-4 text-sm text-gray-700\">{image.name}</h3>\n      <p className=\"mt-1 text-lg font-medium text-gray-900\">{image.username}</p>\n    </a>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we'll want to update our image optimization allowlist to use the Twitter image URL:\n\n```js title=\"next.config.js\"\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  reactStrictMode: true,\n  images: {\n    domains: ['pbs.twimg.com'],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## Deploying to Vercel\n\nOur image gallery is now showing a list of images, fetched from Supabase, and displayed nicely using Tailwind CSS. Let's deploy our Next.js application to Vercel:\n\n1.  Push your code to your git repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket)\n2.  [Import your Next.js project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel\n3.  Add your [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) during the import\n4.  Click \"Deploy\"\n\nVercel will auto-detect you are using Next.js and enable the correct settings for your deployment. Finally, your application is deployed at a URL like [swag.vercel.app](https://swag.vercel.app/).\n\nDuring the build process (`next build`), your application made a request to Supabase (by running `getStaticProps`) to fetch the images needed and generate an HTML file for the page. This file is static and **does not change** when you update your database.\n\nFor example, if you added a new image to the table, it would not be shown on your deployed application without rebuilding the entire app. Let's fix that.\n\n## On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration\n\n[Next.js 12.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1) included a helpful feature called [on-demand ISR](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app/) that allows you to fetch updated data for any page _after_ it's been deployed. [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) allows you to keep the benefits of static files (which are fast and reliable) while still updating your site when data changes.\n\nLet's enable our application to re-run `getStaticProps` when our `images` table changes.\n\n### Supabase Function Hooks\n\nFunction Hooks allow you to listen to any changes on your tables and trigger an asynchronous function. For example:\n\n- I add a new row to my `images` table (i.e. `INSERT`)\n- My function hook is triggered after the database row changes\n- I'm able to call an API Route inside my application to fetch new data and rebuild the page\n\nThis means I'm able to instantly rebuild a single page of my application and push the new file to Vercel's Edge Network in 300ms globally 🤯\n\n### Creating our Revalidation API Route\n\nInside our Next.js application, we'll make a new API Route to revalidate our page. This route is secured by a secret query parameter that our Supabase instance will forward, to ensure that only Supabase can regenerate pages when data changes.\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/api/revalidate.ts\"\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request\n  if (req.query.secret !== process.env.REVALIDATE_SECRET) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    // Regenerate our index route showing the images\n    await res.revalidate('/');\n    return res.json({ revalidated: true });\n  } catch (err) {\n    // If there was an error, Next.js will continue\n    // to show the last successfully generated page\n    return res.status(500).send('Error revalidating');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou'll then want to add this new Environment Variable to your `.env.local` file, as well as on Vercel, before we deploy these changes.\n\n```bash:.env.local\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-value-here\nSUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-value-here\nREVALIDATE_SECRET=your-value-here\n```\n\n### Creating our Function Hook\n\nInside the Supabase dashboard, click on your Database and then:\n\n- Click \"Function Hooks\" on the left sidebar\n- Click \"Create a new hook\"\n- We'll name our hook `update_images`\n- Table → `images`\n- Events → Insert, Update, and Delete\n- Type of hook → HTTP Request\n- HTTP Request Method → POST\n- HTTP Request URL → `your-url.vercel.app/api/revalidate`\n- HTTP Params → Add a new param `secret` with your secret from above\n- Click \"Confirm\"\n\nOur function hook is now active and will make a request to the specified HTTP Request URL whenever the `images` table changes.\n\n## On-Demand ISR in Action\n\nFirst, redeploy your application to Vercel to add the new API Route as well as the new Environment Variable (`REVALIDATE_SECRET`). Next, add a new row to the `images` table inside Supabase.\n\nAfter hitting \"Save\", you should see your deployed application **update instantly**!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we were able to create a Next.js application showing a list of images fetched dynamically from Supabase and instantly update our deployed application whenever data changes.\n\n- [View the code](https://github.com/leerob/image-gallery-supabase-tailwind-nextjs)\n- [View the demo](https://swag.vercel.app)\n- [Try On-Demand ISR](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app/)\n",

      "raw": "\nDevelopers want to write JavaScript -- and they want it to run everywhere -- in the browser, on the server, or at the edge.\n\nWith all its quirks and imperfections, JavaScript continues to rise in adoption due to its built-in growth hack (it's in the browser), its massive ecosystem of tools and libraries, and the continued growth and adoption of TypeScript. And increasingly, developers are able to learn an API (like `Request` or `Response`) and reuse that same knowledge _everywhere_.\n\nHaving an agreed-up common set of APIs (i.e. standards) and platforms that all support that same interface (e.g. cross-browser support) means web developers can now **learn once, write everywhere**.\n\nThis post will outline recent improvements to the web platform across the browser, server, and edge.\n\n## JavaScript: In the Browser\n\nWeb developers today spend less time writing vendor-specific JavaScript or vendor-specific CSS selectors than ever before.\n\n```jsx\nfunction isIE11() {\n  return !!window.MSInputMethodContext && !!document.documentMode;\n}\n```\n\nWe've escaped the world of padding hacks for maintaining an element's [aspect ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio):\n\n```css\n@supports not (aspect-ratio: 16/9) {\n  .aspectRatio {\n    overflow: hidden;\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%;\n    height: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTwo converging trends are making this possible:\n\n- **The death of Internet Explorer:** Now that IE 11 is [officially retired](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-edge-update-will-disable-internet-explorer-in-february/), web developers can write less vendor-specific CSS, leading to smaller stylesheets and fewer hacks.\n\n- **Browser engine alignment:** The three major browser engines (Chromium/Chrome, Gecko/Firefox, and Webkit/Safari) now have the best cross-browser support for JavaScript, CSS, and Web APIs we've ever seen. Kudos to the [Interop project](https://web.dev/interop-2022/).\n\nNow, of course, it's not perfect across browser engines, nor will it likely ever be. But it's the best it's been and I'm optimistic. Thousands (or millions) of developer hours will be saved cumulatively by not spending a week digging into esoteric IE bugs.\n\nHere's an example of how this alignment can benefit all web developers. Imagine you are a framework author trying to write a reusable image component to help thousands of developers achieve great performance when using images. In 2020, just a few years ago, you need to work _around_ the web platform.\n\nLoading an image without causing a [layout shift](https://web.dev/cls/), correctly maintaining the aspect ratio, and not degrading initial page load performance due to image size/weight was difficult to implement with support across all major browsers. This led to developers either ignoring the issues, or the frameworks writing component abstractions that produced code like:\n\n```jsx\n<span> <-- needed to maintain aspect ratio\n  <span> <-- needed to maintain aspect ratio, CSS padding hacks\n    <img src=\"\" style=\"\" /> <-- inline styles to prevent layout shift\n    <noscript>...</noscript> <-- JS needed for IntersectionObserver\n  </span>\n</span>\n```\n\nIt's a different story in 2022. There's cross-browser support for: `aspect-ratio`, [width/height attributes](https://web.dev/optimize-cls/) to prevent layout shift, native [image lazy-loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading), and pure CSS/SVG-based blur-up image placeholders. The above code can drop the wrapping elements and work without runtime JavaScript needed.\n\n```jsx\n<img\n  alt=\"A kitten\"\n  decoding=\"async\"\n  height=\"200\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  src=\"https://placekitten.com/200/200\"\n  style=\"aspect-ratio: auto 1 / 1\"\n  width=\"200\"\n/>\n```\n\n## JavaScript: On the Server\n\nIsomorphic JavaScript, or code that could run on both the client and the server, has been the ideal state for many web developers. Learn once, write everywhere, right? Until recently, Node.js and the web platform were out of alignment.\n\nConsider fetching data over HTTP. In the browser, we had the [Web Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). Prior to Node.js 18, there was no built-in solution for fetching data. Making a `fetch` required using packages like `node-fetch` or `undici`, which had a similar but slightly different API, often in non-obvious ways.\n\nThis lack of alignment between platforms meant that tools for writing isomorphic JavaScript, like Next.js, needed to add polyfills so developers could use `fetch` on both the client and the server. With Node.js 18, these tools can now remove additional JavaScript needed to polyfill platform differences, ultimately resulting in less JavaScript needed.\n\nI'm optimistic about JavaScript (and TypeScript) on the server. It's not just `fetch`, either. It's `Request`, `Response`, and **100+ other APIs** that are now available in both the browser and in Node.js. Browser vendors and companies building server infrastructure are now [working closer than ever](https://wintercg.org/) to provide a standard set of APIs that can run everywhere, including edge computing platforms.\n\n## JavaScript: At the Edge\n\nEdge computing, the often misunderstood and newest target for running JavaScript, has had the least standardization of the three (browser, server, edge).\n\nIt's helpful to think about edge as the highest level of abstraction, where you're spending all of your time on business logic.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Diagram of the edge runtime`}\n  src={`/images/javascript/edge-runtime.png`}\n  width={3840 / 3}\n  height={2160 / 3}\n/>\n\nMoving towards edge computing platforms means a tradeoff for more abstraction, but focusing exclusively on business logic.\n\nEdge isn't something completely new, but rather a deliberate and intentional tradeoff from the existing Node.js world.\n\nYou _want_ to write JavaScript, but edge compute infrastructure requires a lighter subset of the (quite large) Node.js API surface area. By making this tradeoff for a subset of Node.js APIs that also run in the browser, you can have consistently fast cold boots and more cost-effective compute workloads. That sounds _pretty nice_.\n\nLet's look at an example. In this case, I'll use a [Vercel Edge Function](https://vercel.com/blog/edge-functions-generally-available). But it could also be other edge computing platforms like Cloudflare or Deno. For me, the best part of this code is actually that it's fairly boring. It looks like Node.js.\n\n```jsx\nexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'edge'\n}\n\n// Web standard Request API\nexport default function handler(req: Request) {\n  // Web standard URL API\n  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url)\n  const name = searchParams.get('name')\n\n  // Web standard Fetch API\n  const req = await fetch('https://...', { body: { name } })\n  const data = await req.json()\n\n  // Web standard Response (.json is new)\n  // https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/1389\n  return Response.json(data);\n}\n```\n\nHere's the kicker: it's not just about the infrastructure. It's about the frameworks that are embracing these same Web APIs and helping thousands of new developers learn once and write everywhere.\n\nThis code could work with Next.js. Or SvelteKit. Remix. Fresh. Or the next, new web framework that builds upon the same set of standard APIs.\n\n**What an incredible time to be a web developer.**\n",

You had just attempted to load a new page only to be greeted with a painful loading spinner. No one likes this experience.\n\nIt's inevitable that some users of your application will have slow connections. A well thought out design accounts for varying internet speeds and displays a loading state to the user. However, making the user stare at a spinning wheel for an extended period of time can drastically increase bounce rates. What if there was a better way?\n\n### Skeleton Screens\n\nSkeleton screens build anticipation for the content that is going to appear whereas loading spinners (and progress bars) put the focus on the wait time that the user has to endure. Apple has agreed with this idea enough to incorporate skeleton screens into their [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/icons-and-images/launch-screen/). They recommend displaying an outline of the initial application without text or any elements that will change. This can improve the feel of any action taking longer than a few hundred milliseconds.\n\n### Examples\n\nBy now, you've probably seen some examples of skeleton screens in your daily browsing without even noticing. For example - Facebook shows users gray circles and lines to represent the contents of a post in their timeline.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Facebook Placeholder`}\n  src={`/images/loading-placeholder-with-sass/facebook.png`}\n  width={1045}\n  height={680}\n/>\n\nIt's not just Facebook either. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) has also re-designed their layout to use placeholders.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`LinkedIn Placeholder`}\n  src={`/images/loading-placeholder-with-sass/linkedin.png`}\n  width={1618}\n  height={1126}\n/>\n\nYou can trick your users into thinking your website loads faster using skeleton screens. Let's look at how you can actually create this effect using some simple HTML and Scss.\n\n### Building a Placeholder\n\nFirst, let's create the base structure. In this example, the placeholder is supposed to represent a text area. We'll use [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) (Base - Element - Modifier) naming for our classes.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"text-input__loading\">\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n  <div class=\"text-input__loading--line\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nEach line should be about the same height as our text. We can use CSS animation to create a pulsating effect.\n\n```css\n&--line {\n  height: 10px;\n  margin: 10px;\n  animation: pulse 1s infinite ease-in-out;\n}\n```\n\nNext, let's define how our pulse animation should work. We can modify the opacity of the background color using `rgba` to provide an opacity between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n```css\n@keyframes pulse {\n  0% {\n    background-color: rgba(165, 165, 165, 0.1);\n  }\n  50% {\n    background-color: rgba(165, 165, 165, 0.3);\n  }\n  100% {\n    background-color: rgba(165, 165, 165, 0.1);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe also want to vary the width of each loading line. Let's create a Sass mixin to apply the given content to each nth-child in a list.\n\n```css\n@mixin nth-children($points...) {\n  @each $point in $points {\n    &:nth-child(#{$point}) {\n      @content;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe can use the newly created mixin to change the width of all 10 children `div` elements.\n\n```css\n@include nth-children(1, 5, 9) {\n  width: 150px;\n}\n@include nth-children(2, 6, 10) {\n  width: 250px;\n}\n@include nth-children(3, 7) {\n  width: 50px;\n}\n@include nth-children(4, 8) {\n  width: 100px;\n}\n```\n\n### Final Result 🎉\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Loading Placeholder Final Result`}\n  src={`/images/loading-placeholder-with-sass/final-result.gif`}\n  width={650}\n  height={223}\n/>\n\nYou can view the code and a live example on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leerob/pen/XzRzpb?editors=1100). There's also a React library called [react-placeholder](https://github.com/buildo/react-placeholder) that achieves the same effect.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n- [The Nine States of Design](https://medium.com/swlh/the-nine-states-of-design-5bfe9b3d6d85)\n- [How the Facebook content placeholder works](https://cloudcannon.com/deconstructions/2014/11/15/facebook-content-placeholder-deconstruction.html)\n",

    "publishedAt": "2019-11-10",
    "summary": "Learn how to integrate Next.js and React with Mailchimp to build a newsletter subscription form.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nYou've probably noticed the rise of newsletters (especially in the developer community). They're an excellent way to promote content to those who really want to read it. If you've ever thought about starting a newsletter, then you've found the right article.\n\n## Mailchimp vs. The World\n\nIf you're just starting a newsletter, you probably want something with a free tier.\nThat was my rationale for adopting [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/). It was simple, easy to set up, and didn't require an API route. Perfect!\n\nHowever, it wasn't exactly a frictionless sign-up process. When a user clicked \"subscribe\", it launched a pop-up window where they had to confirm their email address again.\nAgain, _it works_, but we can do better.\n\nI started to explore using [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) as an alternative. It also has a [free tier](https://mailchimp.com/pricing/) if you have less than 2,000 subscribers. Perfect.\n\n## Why Next.js?\n\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the easiest way to build applications in React. One of my favorite features is API routes.\n\nAPI routes provide a solution for building a complete API inside Next.js.\nAll you need to get started is an `api/` folder inside your main `pages/` folder where your routes live.\n\nEvery file inside `pages/api/` is mapped to `/api/*`. This is where we'll communicate with Mailchimp.\nFirst, we need to set up an account.\n\n## Setting up Mailchimp\n\nAfter [creating an account](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-an-account/), you'll need to fetch your [API key](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/#find+or+generate+your+api+key).\n\nWhen a user clicks \"subscribe\", we'll want to add their email address to our [audience](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/create-your-first-audience/#add-a-contact-to-an-audience).\nWe'll need to grab a few values:\n\n- The [API server region](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/#make-your-first-api-call) (e.g. `us1`).\n- The [Audience ID](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/) for the mailing list.\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nLet's make our secrets we've retrieved available without hardcoding them into our request. Since I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I'll need to set up some [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).\nFirst, let's create `.env.local` for testing locally.\n\n```bash title=\".env.local\"\nMAILCHIMP_API_KEY=\nMAILCHIMP_API_SERVER=\nMAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID=\n```\n\nFinally, [add these environment variables in Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) so they're available on pull requests (Preview) and in Production.\n\n**Note:** Don't forget to add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore`. We don't want to commit our secrets.\n\n## Creating The Request\n\nNow that we have our values available as environment variables, we can create an API route at `pages/api/subscribe.js` to add a member to our list.\nMake sure you install the `@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing` library.\n\n```js title=\"pages/api/subscribe.js\"\nimport mailchimp from '@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing';\n\nmailchimp.setConfig({\n  apiKey: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_KEY,\n  server: process.env.MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER, // e.g. us1\n});\n\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  const { email } = req.body;\n\n  if (!email) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email is required' });\n  }\n\n  try {\n    await mailchimp.lists.addListMember(process.env.MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID, {\n      email_address: email,\n      status: 'subscribed',\n    });\n\n    return res.status(201).json({ error: '' });\n  } catch (error) {\n    return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message || error.toString() });\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Creating A Form Input\n\nNow that our API is created, we need a way to gather user input. Let's create a component to send a request to our API.\n\n```js title=\"components/Subscribe.js\"\nimport React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Subscribe() {\n  // 1. Create a reference to the input so we can fetch/clear it's value.\n  const inputEl = useRef(null);\n  // 2. Hold a message in state to handle the response from our API.\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  const subscribe = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n\n    // 3. Send a request to our API with the user's email address.\n    const res = await fetch('/api/subscribe', {\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        email: inputEl.current.value,\n      }),\n      headers: {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      },\n      method: 'POST',\n    });\n\n    const { error } = await res.json();\n\n    if (error) {\n      // 4. If there was an error, update the message in state.\n      setMessage(error);\n\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // 5. Clear the input value and show a success message.\n    inputEl.current.value = '';\n    setMessage('Success! 🎉 You are now subscribed to the newsletter.');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={subscribe}>\n      <label htmlFor=\"email-input\">{'Email Address'}</label>\n      <input\n        id=\"email-input\"\n        name=\"email\"\n        placeholder=\"you@awesome.com\"\n        ref={inputEl}\n        required\n        type=\"email\"\n      />\n      <div>\n        {message\n          ? message\n          : `I'll only send emails when new content is posted. No spam.`}\n      </div>\n      <button type=\"submit\">{'✨ Subscribe 💌'}</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you'd like to see a completed example, the entire source code for my blog is [open source](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/bfbd33a822fbcbbafd4027aa45884446f6f8ff3c/pages/api/subscribe.js).\n",

      "raw": "\nY Combinator is famous for their advice: make something people want.\n\nIt's simple and direct—relentlessly focus on your customer.\n\nHowever, when those customers are developers, I'd argue the execution of this advice looks different and might be counter-intuitive from what people generally want.\n\nHere's what you should do to make something developers want:\n\n1. [You should embrace open-source](#1-you-should-embrace-open-source)\n2. [You should have a free tier](#2-you-should-have-a-free-tier)\n3. [You should have excellent documentation](#3-you-should-have-excellent-documentation)\n4. [You should be able to get support from developers](#4-you-should-be-able-to-get-support-from-developers)\n5. [You should be part of a community](#5-you-should-be-part-of-a-community)\n\n## 1. You should embrace open-source\n\nExperienced developers love open-source products because they've seen the opposite. They've struggled to debug a “black box” closed-source tool, or worse, had a previously open tool change licenses or close its source code.\n\nNew developers love open-source products because they're learning skills that help them advance in their career—their knowledge transfers from company to company.\n\nOpen-source developer tools often have better documentation and educational material, too.\n\n## 2. You should have a free tier\n\nDevelopers don't want to talk to your sales team. They want to try out the product with as little friction as possible. Start free, then grow, once they've validated the product works and will solve their needs.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule. You might have procured software that required months of negotiations, license keys to get access, and hand guided provisioning of resources from a human. But ask your developer—they would have preferred if they could have started self-serve.\n\n“Try it before you buy it” isn't novel sales advice, but developers are outliers in this demographic.\n\n## 3. You should have excellent documentation\n\nThe better the documentation, the more likely the developer is to try your product.\n\nThis isn't about specific UI features like dark mode or ⌘+K search dialogs. How quickly can they find an answer to their problem? Great documentation is either a reference guide or an educational tool.\n\nEducational material should be equally compelling for both beginners and experts. Experts love to hear concepts explained in a simple way. Beginners want new concepts progressively explained. Don't drop ten new concepts and five acronyms right away. Write like you're teaching beginners.\n\nHere's more thoughts on [what makes a great developer experience](/blog/developer-experience-examples).\n\n## 4. You should be able to get support from developers\n\nWhen developers can't find the answer in your documentation, they'll reach out to support.\n\nThey want to talk to someone who empathizes and understands their problems. It's easy to tell whether the support person actually “gets it”. Minimize the number of hops between problem and solution, ideally cutting out layers of humans in the middle.\n\nThis is why roles like Developer Advocates or Customer Success Engineers exist. Developers expect to talk to developers.\n\n## 5. You should be part of a community\n\nWhere do developers go to hang out? Online and in-person communities.\n\nThis doesn't mean you need to _start_ a community for your product. In fact, you probably shouldn't. Instead, look at where the developers are already spending time. Go there. Talk to them and contribute to the discourse.\n\nCommunities are not a transactional relationship. You are there to provide value. This is a long game, sometimes taking years to materialize value back, but then obvious in hindsight.\n",

    "title": "Improving My Next.js MDX Blog",
    "publishedAt": "2020-03-29",
    "summary": "I revamped my personal site, adding a variety of improvements for the ideal Next.js + MDX blogging experience.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nI recently decided to redesign and revamp my site. I had a few main goals:\n\n1. Easier content management for blog posts\n1. Simplified, minimal design\n1. Dark mode support\n\n## Simplified Design\n\nBefore this redesign, I hand-rolled all of my components using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).\nI was trying to maintain a consistent design, so I'd extract shared values out into a theme.\n\n```js\nexport const colors = {\n  accent: '#ff5252',\n  background: '#0a6159',\n  border: '#dcdcdc',\n  grey: {\n      100: '#F5F7FA',\n      200: '#E4E7EB',\n      300: '#CBD2D9',\n      400: '#9AA5B1',\n      500: '#7B8794',\n      600: '#616E7C',\n      700: '#52606D',\n      800: '#3E4C59',\n      900: '#323F4B',\n      1000: '#1F2933'\n  },\n  light: '#606060',\n  text: '#101010'\n};\n\nexport const spacing = {\n  extrasmall: '0.5em',\n  small: '1em'\n  normal: '1.5em',\n  large: '2em',\n  extralarge: '2.5em',\n};\n```\n\nFront-end tooling has rapidly progressed, and projects like [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) make it easy\nto create components that easily adhere to your design system.\n\nMy site isn't anything crazy – mostly a few simple static pages and blog posts. While coding everything myself is a\nfun learning experience, there are plenty of component libraries that contain everything necessary to achieve the\ndesign I was aiming for. That's why I chose to adopt [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for my redesign.\n\n- It uses styled-system under the hood, allowing me to use style props\n- The theme is extendable, allowing me to change fonts and add icons easily\n- It includes a great set of accessible components out of the box\n- Works well with Next.js and supports dark mode\n\nHere's a quick example of Chakra UI and styled-system. This is part of the source for\nthe newsletter subscription at the bottom of this post.\n\n```js title=\"components/Subscribe.js\"\n<Box\n  border=\"1px solid\"\n  borderColor=\"blue.200\"\n  bg=\"blue.50\"\n  borderRadius={4}\n  padding={6}\n  my={4}\n>\n  <Heading as=\"h5\" size=\"lg\" mb={2}>\n    Subscribe to the newsletter\n  </Heading>\n  <Text>\n    Get emails from me about web development, tech, and early access to new\n    articles.\n  </Text>\n  <InputGroup size=\"md\" mt={4}>\n    <Input\n      aria-label=\"Email for newsletter\"\n      placeholder=\"tim@apple.com\"\n      type=\"email\"\n    />\n    <InputRightElement width=\"6.75rem\">\n      <Button fontWeight=\"bold\" h=\"1.75rem\" size=\"sm\">\n        Subscribe\n      </Button>\n    </InputRightElement>\n  </InputGroup>\n</Box>\n```\n\nUsing [style props](https://styled-system.com/getting-started), I'm able to easily style my components while pulling values directly from\nmy design system. For example, `mb` (short for `margin-bottom`) of `2` will translate to `0.5rem` or `~8px`.\n\n> **Update 2020:** I've [switched to Tailwind CSS](/blog/tailwind) now.\n\n## Improved Content Management\n\nI wanted to decrease the amount of friction it took to create new articles,\nas well as improve maintainability over time.\n\nPreviously, I maintained a JSON file containing all my articles.\n\n```js title=\"data/articles.json\"\nexport default [\n  {\n    date: 'February 24, 2020',\n    slug: 'fetching-data-with-swr',\n    title:\n      'Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes - Fetching Data with SWR',\n  },\n  {\n    date: 'February 18, 2020',\n    slug: 'google-analytics-api-nextjs',\n    title: 'Create a Dashboard with Next.js API Routes - Google Analytics API',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nThen, I iterated over this list to display all articles when viewing `leerob.io/blog`.\nThis approach worked, but it meant that I had two sources of truth.\n\nEach `.mdx` blog post already contained this information, as well as other metadata passed to `<Post />`.\nEvery time I added a new article, I had to change two places.\n\n```js\nexport const meta = {\n  date: '2019-12-26',\n  description: 'Highlights and reflections on 2019 and a look forward to 2020.',\n  image: '/images/2019/banner.jpg',\n  slug: '2019',\n  title: '2019 Year in Review',\n};\n\nexport default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>;\n```\n\nI decided to use Markdown front matter instead. Now, each `.mdx` file has a top section like this:\n\n```js\ntitle: '2019 Year in Review';\npublishedAt: '2019-12-26';\nsummary: 'Highlights and reflections on 2019 and a look forward to 2020.';\nimage: '/images/2019/banner.jpg';\n```\n\nNow, I can use native Next.js functionality like `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` to fetch my MDX content:\n\n```js title=\"pages/blog/[slug].js\"\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const posts = await getFiles('blog');\n\n  return {\n    paths: posts.map((p) => ({\n      params: {\n        slug: p.replace(/\\.mdx/, ''),\n      },\n    })),\n    fallback: false,\n  };\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const post = await getFileBySlug('blog', params.slug);\n\n  return { props: { ...post } };\n}\n```\n\n> **Update 2021:** I've moved to [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/).\n\n## MDX Plugins\n\n`mdx-bundler` allows you to extend [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype), providing external plugins to hook into the compilation process. Some plugins I've added:\n\n- [rehype-slug](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug)\n- [rehype-code-titles](https://github.com/josestg/rehype-code-title)\n- [rehype-autolink-headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings)\n- [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/timlrx/rehype-prism-plus)\n\n```js title=\"lib/mdx.js\"\nimport { join } from 'path';\nimport { readFileSync } from 'fs';\nimport { bundleMDX } from 'mdx-bundler';\nimport readingTime from 'reading-time';\n\nimport rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug';\nimport rehypeCodeTitles from 'rehype-code-titles';\nimport rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings';\nimport rehypePrism from 'rehype-prism-plus';\n\nexport async function getFileBySlug(type, slug) {\n  const source = readFileSync(\n    join(process.cwd(), 'data', type, `${slug}.mdx`),\n    'utf8'\n  );\n  const { code, frontmatter } = await bundleMDX(source, {\n    xdmOptions(options) {\n      options.rehypePlugins = [\n        ...(options?.rehypePlugins ?? []),\n        rehypeSlug,\n        rehypeCodeTitles,\n        rehypePrism,\n        [\n          rehypeAutolinkHeadings,\n          {\n            properties: {\n              className: ['anchor'],\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      ];\n      return options;\n    },\n  });\n\n  return {\n    code,\n    frontMatter: {\n      wordCount: source.split(/\\s+/gu).length,\n      readingTime: readingTime(source),\n      slug: slug || null,\n      ...frontmatter,\n    },\n  };\n}\n```\n\nThis added some nice additional features:\n\n- Hover over a heading and click on `#` to link directly to it.\n- Use `language:title` to add titles to code snippets.\n- [Reading time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time) of articles.\n\n## Better Syntax Highlighting\n\nPreviously, I directly imported a `prism.css` theme alongside `react-syntax-highlighter` to provide syntax highlighting.\nThis approach did not allow me to easily change styles based on the theme. Thus, I kept the code style always dark.\n\nInstead, I switched to [rehype-prism-plus](https://github.com/Val-istar-Guo/rehype-prism)\nand created two prism themes for dark/light mode. `rehype-prism-plus` also adds line highlighting capabilities 🎉\n\n```js title=\"styles/prism.js\"\nimport { css } from '@emotion/react';\nimport { theme } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\nconst prismBaseTheme = css`\n  // Base styling\n`;\n\nexport const prismLightTheme = css`\n  // Light mode\n`;\n\nexport const prismDarkTheme = css`\n  // Dark mode\n`;\n```\n\n```js:_app.js\nconst { colorMode } = useColorMode();\nconst prismTheme = colorMode === 'light' ? prismLightTheme : prismDarkTheme;\n```\n\n> **Update 2020:** I've [switched to Tailwind CSS](/blog/tailwind) now and use the native Dark Mode support. I also recommend [Shiki](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/).\n\n## Summary\n\nOutside of my main goals, I was able to sneak in some other fun additions:\n\n- Show [view counts](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/components/BlogPost.tsx) for all blog posts, dynamically pulled from Firebase\n- Faster page load times\n- Switched to [Inter](/blog/fonts) as my main font\n- Fewer files, and a _lot_ of deleted code!\n\nThe best part?

    "summary": "Learn how I migrated my Next.js website to use MySQL with PlanetScale, resulting in 10x faster response times for my APIs.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nA few weeks ago, I [moved this site](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/pull/326) from using [Firebase](/blog/real-time-post-views) and [Redis](/blog/serverless-redis-nextjs) to PlanetScale. [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com) is a serverless database platform built on MySQL and Vitess. Here's why I picked PlanetScale:\n\n- **Database Branching:** I'm able to use my database with the same mental model as git. For each change to my database schema, I open a deploy request. Then, I can merge those changes back into my main database branch.\n- **Prisma Support:** In combination with Prisma, it's _so easy_ to handle database migrations. I haven't moved to Prisma (yet) but will soon.\n- **Connectionless:** Since PlanetScale is serverless, it's built to withstand thousands of simultaneous connections. You can almost consider this _connectionless_ – the developer doesn't need to worry about [pooling or other common objections](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1430177168307412998).\n- **Insanely Fast:** After testing 13 databases, PlanetScale was the [fastest to deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zmYHn82cY8). Now, after using it for a few weeks and monitoring performance, I'm seeing APIs resolve in `~150ms` on average (see [results](#results) below).\n\nI had a chance to talk with [Nick from PlanetScale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqBG5rFP4Ic) on a stream last month if you want to see a live demo of the workflow.\n\n## Why Firebase and Redis?\n\nThis site previously used [Firebase](/blog/real-time-post-views) and [Redis](/blog/serverless-redis-nextjs) for real-time blog post views and [my guestbook](/guestbook). The primary decision for choosing these technologies was to learn. I learn best by experimenting and building. I even [created a course](https://react2025.com/) showing how to use Firebase with Next.js, if you're interested.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1434355662935314432\" />\n\nBoth Firebase and Redis (through [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)) are easy to get started, scale without thinking, and work great in serverless environments. However, I wanted to move to something [SQL-based](/blog/backend) (either MySQL or PostgreSQL) for a new learning experience. I've previously written about [choosing your backend](/blog/backend) and landed on PlanetScale.\n\n## Rebuilding SQL\n\nI found myself writing JavaScript in places where SQL has the functionality built-in. For example, I used Firebase to fetch a JSON object `views` and then summed the values together to find the total number of views.\n\n```jsx\nconst snapshot = await db.ref('views').once('value');\nconst views = snapshot.val();\nconst allViews = Object.values(views).reduce((total, value) => total + value);\n```\n\nWith SQL, you can use `SUM()` instead. Easier? Yeah. Better? Probably debatable, but I like it.\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(count) as total\nFROM views;\n```\n\nSame thing with sorting. Before I was using JavaScript `sort` and now I can use `ORDER BY`. Firebase does have [something similar](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/order-limit-data), I just wasn't using it.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM guestbook\nORDER BY updated_at DESC;\n```\n\n## Why MySQL and PlanetScale?\n\nSQL is boring, proven technology. It's been around for years and will continue to be around for years. I've used it before in prior jobs, but still felt I could understand it better. I also enjoy using PostgreSQL (and recommend Supabase) and strongly considered that solution as well. I'm planning to build a different project with Supabase soon.\n\nI'm also a strong believer in using tools I recommend. Without actually getting my hands dirty in code and running an application in production, it's hard to confidently recommend a product to others. After using the [PlanetScale Vercel Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/planetscale), I was blown away. I could deploy an entire fullstack application in a few clicks. And as I mentioned at the start, database migrations aligned with my mental model.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1426215788407627784\" />\n\n## Migrating Existing Data\n\nThere are likely better ways to do this, but my hacky solution to migrate data into PlanetScale was as follows:\n\n- Export JSON data from my Firebase Realtime Database\n\n  <Image\n    alt={`Exporting data from Firebase`}\n    src={`/images/mysql-planetscale/firebase.png`}\n    width={2905 / 2}\n    height={1959 / 2}\n  />\n\n- Export JSON data from my Redis cluster using `HVALS` and TablePlus\n\n  <Image\n    alt={`Exporting data from my Redis cluster`}\n    src={`/images/mysql-planetscale/redis.png`}\n    width={2540 / 2}\n    height={1852 / 2}\n  />\n\n- Create a new database branch in PlanetScale for the schema migration adding the tables\n- Create two new API routes, which loaded the JSON data and `INSERT INTO` MySQL\n- Verify on the database branch the APIs correctly process and migrate the data\n- Create a deploy request with the new schema changes and merge it into `main`\n- Finally, hit the APIs to migrate the JSON data into `main`\n- Done!\n\nHere are the two scripts I used, for reference.\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/api/migrate-redis.js\"\nimport db from 'lib/planetscale';\nimport guestbookData from 'data/guestbook';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const toISOString = (unixTimestampInMs) =>\n    new Date(unixTimestampInMs).toJSON().slice(0, 19).replace('T', ' ');\n\n  let query = `INSERT INTO guestbook (email, updated_at, body, created_by)\n    VALUES `;\n\n  const escapeStr = (str) =>\n    str\n      .replace(/\\\\/g, '\\\\\\\\')\n      .replace(/\\$/g, '\\\\$')\n      .replace(/'/g, \"\\\\'\")\n      .replace(/\"/g, '\\\\\"');\n\n  guestbookData.forEach((item, key) => {\n    var value = JSON.parse(item['value']);\n\n    query += `(\"${\n      value.email ? `${value.email}` : 'not@provided.com'\n    }\", \"${toISOString(value.updated_at)}\", \"${escapeStr(value.body)}\", \"${\n      value.created_by\n    }\")`;\n\n    if (key === guestbookData.length - 1) {\n      query += ';';\n    } else {\n      query += ', ';\n    }\n  });\n\n  const [rows] = await db.query(query);\n\n  return res.status(201).json(rows[0]);\n}\n```\n\n```jsx title=\"pages/api/migrate-firebase.js\"\nimport db from 'lib/planetscale';\nimport viewsData from 'data/views';\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  let query = `INSERT INTO views (slug, count)\n    VALUES `;\n\n  const slugs = Object.keys(viewsData['views']);\n\n  slugs.forEach((slug, key) => {\n    const count = viewsData['views'][slug];\n\n    query += `(\"${slug}\", ${count})`;\n\n    if (key === slugs.length - 1) {\n      query += ';';\n    } else {\n      query += ', ';\n    }\n  });\n\n  const [rows] = await db.query(query);\n\n  return res.status(201).json(rows[0]);\n}\n```\n\nHere's my PlanetScale schema for tracking post views and guestbook entries.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE `views` (\n  `slug` varchar(128) NOT NULL,\n  `count` bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT '1',\n  PRIMARY KEY (`slug`)\n)\n\nCREATE TABLE `guestbook` (\n  `id` bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  `email` varchar(256) NOT NULL,\n  `body` varchar(500) NOT NULL,\n  `created_by` varchar(256) NOT NULL,\n  `created_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),\n  `updated_at` datetime(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6),\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)\n)\n```\n\n## Results\n\nI've been monitoring the performance of my production APIs connecting to PlanetScale with [Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com). Checkly allows me to set alerts if there's downtime or if performance decreases below my accepted threshold. For the last week, I've seen latency of `~150ms` for my Next.js API Routes, deployed as serverless functions on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) in `us-east`.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Checkly results from PlanetScale database`}\n  src={`/images/mysql-planetscale/checkly.png`}\n  width={1490}\n  height={528}\n/>\n\nThis has been significantly faster than my previous Firebase implementation. Can you tell when I made the switch? 😁\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Checkly results after switching from Firebase to PlanetScale`}\n  src={`/images/mysql-planetscale/checkly-firebase.png`}\n  width={2264 / 2}\n  height={1076 / 2}\n/>\n\nI'm pleased with the results of the migration. Having one service instead of two cleaned up the code and required fewer environment variables to connect to each service. I was also somewhat _abusing_ Redis for my guestbook, where SQL is a better fit.\n\nNext up, Prisma!\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\nNext.js Conf exceeded all my expectations this year.\n\n**110,000+ registered** and **55,000+ joined live** to watch the keynote and community talks. Hundreds of developers joined live in San Francisco, London, and New York.\n\nThis conference was unlike any I've attended before – we put _so much effort_ into creating a unique experience, both for those online and in person.\n\nBuilding and growing a community is the most rewarding part of my role, and I'd like to take you behind the scenes on all things Next.js Conf 2022.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1584969722189484032\" />\n\n## Better ingredients, better pizza, Next.js Conf\n\n'Twas the night before Conf™️ and we hosted a small community dinner at a local pizzeria. **It was invigorating.** Old friends getting back together after years – and new friends joining from around the world to talk JavaScript and the Web.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1585755520543039488\" />\n\nOne person told me:\n\n**\"The food was good, the people were great, and the conversation was even better\"**\n\nHonestly, it doesn't get much better than that for me.\n\n## We'll do it live¹\n\nOur team sprinted towards the Conf finish line, trying to get everything ready for the big day. I told myself \"Oh, we'll worry about the pre-show later, first we need to do [x, y, z]\". Welp. Turn out preparing for things makes you more prepared.\n\nIt was kind of hilarious – Delba and I went to practice that morning and we both couldn't really make words come out of our mouths. A combination of nerves and excitement. I became stressed, 30 minutes before we were scheduled to go live in front of thousands of people.\n\nBut... the lack of scripting and planning actually led to a _great_ outcome. We truly did it live – it felt authentic. To warm up the conference before the keynote, Delba and I bantered back and forth about the upcoming day of talks and brought community members and conf speakers up on the stage.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1584956560832614400\" />\n\nThank you again [Rich](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris), [Una](https://twitter.com/Una), [Dan](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx), and [Kap](https://twitter.com/kapehe_ok) for joining us. Y'all are the best.\n\n## Next.js 13 Pro Max by Vercel: Starting at $1299\n\nAfter finishing the pre-show, Delba and I walked backstage to get mic'd up before the keynote Q&A. Guillermo was about to go out on stage. We wished him good luck, and off he went.\n\nI watched the live monitor backstage and heard the crowd cheer. The gravity of the moment sunk in. I started jumping around with excitement. All the work had led to this moment.\n\nThere were _so_ many tweets. I think my phone froze. And the _memes_ – the memes were incredible.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1584974847306002432\" />\n\nThe light-hearted jokes and slight roast of our very-clearly-Apple-inspired-love of the keynote made me smile and seemed fun for the whole community.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Me hosting the Q&A with Next.js and React team members after the keynote.`}\n  src={`/images/nextjs-conf-2022-recap/qna.jpg`}\n  width={2000 / 2}\n  height={1293 / 2}\n/>\n\nYou can [rewatch the keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiknNI_0J48) in case you missed it, or [read my summary tweet thread](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1585349567410626560).\n\n## Hybrid theory²\n\nAfter some Q&A, we kicked off the 27 community talks.\n\nWe wanted an equally great experience, whether you attended online or in person. I think there's still room to improve, but there's one specific piece I'm very happy with.\n\nThe community talks were pre-recorded. Speakers were able to prepare, polish, and submit their best work ahead of time. Then, we flew them to San Francisco so they could all meet each other, interact with the community, and enjoy the day. No pre-talk anxiety.\n\nThe quality of content and speakers this year was the best it's ever been. We're releasing all of the talks on the Vercel YouTube, if you want to [check out the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq&)¹.\n\n## And after the party is the hotel lobby³\n\nHassan and I spent _a lot_ of time thinking about the after-party. An event where you could have a drink and enjoy some music, or instead, escape to a quiet space to socialize and play games.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1585134730017935360\" />\n\nMy original _inspo_ was \"make it like a Daft Punk concert\" but with arcade games. By the end of the night, most people were in heated competition in foosball or table tennis.\n\nKudos to [Hassan](https://twitter.com/nutlope) for an event well done.\n\n## Disney adults or Pokémon trainers?\n\nThe most underrated part of the conference was pin collecting and trading.\n\nThere were 15 different collectible pins. You could only obtain some by talking to specific people (like Evil Rabbit or Rich Harris for Svelte). Others you had to visit specific places (like the after party).\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1585015842659786752\" />\n\nWatching everyone collect/trade pins and flaunt them on their conference lanyards was awesome. I didn't know this was a [Disney thing](https://www.shopdisney.com/toys-collectibles/collectibles/pins/) until someone pointed it out. I was just trying to level up my _Nexteon_, which I'm going to assume is one of the [Eevee evolutions](<https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eevee_(Pok%C3%A9mon)>).\n\n## Making ship happen\n\nOh yeah, we also shipped some stuff:\n\n- [Next.js 13](http://nextjs.org/13)\n- [Turbopack](https://vercel.com/blog/turbopack)\n- [Vercel Analytics, now with page views](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-acquires-splitbee)\n- [New Turborepo / Turbopack landing pages](https://turbo.build/)\n- [New Vercel Analytics landing page](https://vercel.com/analytics)\n- [New Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) / [Next.js home pages](http://nextjs.org/)\n- [Next.js beta docs for the `app/` directory](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs)\n\nI can't understate the team effort it took to pull this event off. So many Vercelians played a vital role in its success.

      "raw": "\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\n\nThis post has been updated for the Next.js 13 `app` directory.\n\n</Callout>\n\nThis guide will show you how to use Firebase 9+ with Next.js and deploy it to Vercel.\n\n### Connecting to Firebase\n\n1. Create a project in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart).\n1. In the Firebase console, open Settings > Service Accounts.\n1. Click Generate New Private Key, then confirm by clicking Generate Key.\n1. Download and open the JSON file containing your service account.\n1. Create a new file `.env.local` and add environment variables with those values.\n\n```bash: title=\".env.local\"\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=replace-me\nFIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=replace-me\nFIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=replace-me\n```\n\nYou can now fetch data from Firebase directly inside a Server Component in the `app` directory:\n\n```js title=\"app/page.tsx\"\nimport 'server-only';\nimport { notFound } from 'next/navigation';\nimport * as admin from 'firebase-admin';\n\nif (!admin.apps.length) {\n  admin.initializeApp({\n    credential: admin.credential.cert({\n      projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,\n      clientEmail: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\n      privateKey: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\\\n/g, '\\n'),\n    }),\n  });\n}\n\nconst db = admin.firestore();\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const user = await db.collection('users').doc('leerob').get();\n\n  if (!user.exists) {\n    notFound();\n  }\n\n  return <div>Hello, {user.data().name}!</div>;\n}\n```\n\nSince all components used inside the `app` directory are Server Components by default, they are only executed on the server. This means you can safely use environment variables without exposing them to the client.\n\nFor added security and peace of mind, the `page` is marked as `server-only`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- [View the code](https://github.com/leerob/nextjs-vercel-firebase)\n- [View the demo](https://nextjs-vercel-firebase.vercel.app/)\n- [Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fleerob%2Fnextjs-vercel-firebase&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY&project-name=nextjs-firebase&repo-name=nextjs-firebase)\n- [Read: Data Fetching Fundamentals](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/fundamentals)\n- [Read: Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components)\n- [Read: Mutating Data](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/data-fetching/mutating)\n",

    "publishedAt": "2020-03-02",
    "summary": "Learn how to add a dynamic sitemap to your Next.js project, along with a robots.txt file for optimal SEO.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nTo improve your Search Engine Optimization (SEO), you might need to add a sitemap or `robots.txt` file to your Next.js site.\n\nA **sitemap** defines the relationship between pages of your site. Search engines utilize\nthis file to more accurately index your site. You can also provide additional information\nsuch as last updated time, how frequently the page changes, and more.\n\nA **robots.txt** file tells search engines which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.\n\n## Static Sitemaps\n\nIf your site does not update frequently, you might currently have a static sitemap.\nThis is a basic `.xml` file defining the content of your site. Here's a simple example:\n\n```xml\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\n  <url>\n      <loc>https://leerob.io</loc>\n  </url>\n  <url>\n      <loc>https://leerob.io/blog</loc>\n  </url>\n</urlset>\n```\n\nAs your site scales, you will probably want to create your sitemap dynamically.\n\n## Dynamic Sitemaps\n\nIf your site frequently changes, you should dynamically create a sitemap.\nLet's first look at an example where your site content is file-based (e.g., contained inside the `/pages` directory).\n\nFirst, let's add `globby` so we can fetch a list of routes.\n\n```bash\n$ yarn add --dev globby\n```\n\n> **Note:** `globby` [might not work](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/issues/293) on Windows.\n\nNext, we can create a Node script at `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`.\nThis file will dynamically build a sitemap based on your `/pages` directory.\n\n```js\nimport { writeFileSync } from 'fs';\nimport { globby } from 'globby';\nimport prettier from 'prettier';\n\nasync function generate() {\n  const prettierConfig = await prettier.resolveConfig('./.prettierrc.js');\n  const pages = await globby([\n    'pages/*.js',\n    'data/**/*.mdx',\n    '!data/*.mdx',\n    '!pages/_*.js',\n    '!pages/api',\n    '!pages/404.js',\n  ]);\n\n  const sitemap = `\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\n        ${pages\n          .map((page) => {\n            const path = page\n              .replace('pages', '')\n              .replace('data', '')\n              .replace('.js', '')\n              .replace('.mdx', '');\n            const route = path === '/index' ? '' : path;\n\n            return `\n              <url>\n                  <loc>${`https://leerob.io${route}`}</loc>\n              </url>\n            `;\n          })\n          .join('')}\n    </urlset>\n    `;\n\n  const formatted = prettier.format(sitemap, {\n    ...prettierConfig,\n    parser: 'html',\n  });\n\n  // eslint-disable-next-line no-sync\n  writeFileSync('public/sitemap.xml', formatted);\n}\n\ngenerate();\n```\n\nFinally, add `postbuild` script in your `package.json` to run this script after `next build` completes.\nYour generated file gets created at `public/sitemap.xml` which is then accessible from the root of your site.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"postbuild\": \"node ./scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs\",\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## External Content\n\nIf you have externally hosted data (e.g., a CMS), you'll need to make an API request\nbefore you can create your sitemap. This implementation will vary depending on your data source,\nbut the idea is the same. To demonstrate, I've created an example using placeholder data.\n\nFirst, create a new file at `pages/sitemap.xml.js`.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nclass Sitemap extends React.Component {\n  static async getInitialProps({ res }) {\n    const request = await fetch(EXTERNAL_DATA_URL);\n    const posts = await request.json();\n\n    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');\n    res.write(createSitemap(posts));\n    res.end();\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Sitemap;\n```\n\nWhen the route `/sitemap.xml` is initially loaded, we will fetch posts from an external data source\nand then write an XML file as the response.\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nconst EXTERNAL_DATA_URL = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts';\n\nconst createSitemap = (posts) => `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\n        ${posts\n          .map(({ id }) => {\n            return `\n                <url>\n                    <loc>${`${EXTERNAL_DATA_URL}/${id}`}</loc>\n                </url>\n            `;\n          })\n          .join('')}\n    </urlset>\n    `;\n\nclass Sitemap extends React.Component {\n  static async getInitialProps({ res }) {\n    const request = await fetch(EXTERNAL_DATA_URL);\n    const posts = await request.json();\n\n    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');\n    res.write(createSitemap(posts));\n    res.end();\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Sitemap;\n```\n\nHere's a condensed example of the output.\n\n```xml\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\n  <url>\n      <loc>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1</loc>\n  </url>\n  <url>\n      <loc>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2</loc>\n  </url>\n</urlset>\n```\n\n## robots.txt\n\nFinally, we can create a static file at `public/robots.txt` to define which\nfiles can be crawled and where the sitemap is located.\n\n```bash\nUser-agent: *\nSitemap: https://leerob.io/sitemap.xml\n```\n",

      "raw": "\nThe divide between frontend and backend engineers is increasingly less useful:\n\n- **Frontend developers** are no longer just writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's now common to see a frontend-focused developer build an entire web application from scratch. They integrate and connect to databases, handle authentication, and more.\n- **Backend developers** are often forced to choose between two paths: writing more frontend code to support their backend, or moving closer towards managing, maintaining, and building software infrastructure used by the former developers.\n- **AI-enhanced developers** have shifted the focus from simply writing code to creating great products. Startups are increasingly feeling this shift, running a more lean engineering team that uses LLMs and coding copilots to move faster.\n\nConsider two different verticals: **Product and Platform Engineers**.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1631691930345037824\" />\n\n## What are Product Engineers?\n\nProduct Engineers work backwards from the desired product experience to the set of technologies that enable it. They consider the frontend, backend, design, and everything in between to create a great user experience.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1659610352588562433\" />\n\nThey don't need to understand every part deeply, a common misconception of \"fullstack\". Instead, they have a broad understanding of the available tools and deep experience _applying_ those tools to build products.\n\nSome qualities of a great Product Engineer:\n\n- **Iterative:** They value [iteration velocity](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1681694545845833729) and incremental correctness. They'd rather ship, get feedback from customers, and adjust along the way—rather than building in a silo.\n- **Customer focused:** They aren't afraid to engage with customers and learn how to improve the product. At a larger company, the Product Manager might specialize here, but should work closely with the engineer to _apply_ those learnings to the correct solutions.\n- **Pragmatic:** They understand that technology choices are all means to an end. Choosing the latest JavaScript library doesn't matter if no one uses your product. They are willing to remove tools if they aren't helping fulfill their product goals.\n\nOkay, so what does that leave the other half of the software engineers?\n\n## Product vs. Platform Engineering\n\nWhile Product Engineers focus on building and enhancing features that solve end user problems, [Platform Engineers](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1097334440169107456) focus on the infrastructure that supports the product.\n\nPlatform Engineering teams are building or buying tools to support Product Engineers and make them more efficient, productive, and happier. They're typically making the infrastructure choices for the Product teams.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1404914237437190144\" />\n\nTypically, platforms teams were only something accessible for larger organizations. Increasingly, a small but effective group of Platform Engineers can make incredibly impactful decisions, even for smaller teams. They are thoughtful about evaluating and purchasing software to grow with the scale of their product team.\n\n## Finding Talent\n\nMost startups are looking for Fullstack Engineers but [actually need Product Engineers](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mztwo_im-seeing-startups-value-a-different-kind-activity-7084894252568039424-eJ3M/).\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1686489366204645379\" />\n\nThe best Product Engineers share two common qualities:\n\n1. A passion for **building high-quality experiences**\n2. A constant drive to **learn and explore new ideas**\n\nThey're not pixel-pushers; they're creators who take pride in their work and are not afraid to stand behind their products. They should have plenty of examples of their work, because so much of it is user facing.\n\nThey understand web fundamentals, such as browsers, accessibility, animations, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The tools they use—be it React, Svelte, or something else—are secondary. What truly matters is their ability to use these tools to build the best product possible.\n\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\n\nThe title shift from Fullstack → Product Engineer has some prior art.\n\nDesign has seen a similar shift. Titles like UI/UX Designer and Graphic Designer are increasingly being replaced by **Product Designer**.\n\n</Callout>\n\nGreat Product Engineers don't stop at visually complete. They carefully consider the user journeys. What happens if there's slow (or no) internet connection? What if this API returns an error? How does this experience work on touch devices? What latency numbers should we strive for?\n\nWhat seems like an excessive amount of polish to others is normal for these developers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen I tweeted [\"Product Engineer > Fullstack Engineer\"](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1687444748884201473), I was surprised by the response.\n\nAt [Vercel](http://vercel.com), we updated our job descriptions to change references from Fullstack to Product Engineers. I've noticed others [doing the same](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1539926726515593217).\n\nProduct Engineers represent a shift in web development. Especially with the [rise of AI](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer), there's a growing need for developers who do more than \"just write code\" — developers who understand the bigger picture, who can work across various technologies, and who focus on delivering exceptional products to the end user.\n\n### Further Reading\n\n- [The Product-Minded Software Engineer\n  ](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer)\n- [PM at Atlassian on Product Engineers](https://sherifmansour.medium.com/product-engineers-f424da766871)\n- [Stop just using “Frontend” or “Backend” to describe the Engineering you like](https://medium.com/@michlimlim/stop-just-using-frontend-or-backend-to-describe-the-engineering-you-like-e8c392956ada)\n",

      "raw": "\nAnalyzing the [top 10,000 publicly accessible](https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million) websites on the internet, we see an interesting trend: **~6%** are now built with React frameworks¹.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1604880119666905088\" />\n\nYou should consider using a framework (instead of building your own) because:\n\n1.  Less time connecting tools, more time building products\n2.  Easier onboarding and training of new developers\n3.  Flexibility for different rendering strategies (server, client, or static)\n4.  Opinionated choices prevent bikeshedding\n5.  Deploy anywhere and incrementally adopt\n6.  It's still just React\n\nBut before we explore why you should use a framework, it's helpful to step back and look at the evolution of React.\n\n## React is evolving\n\nReact changed how developers build for the web, popularizing breaking down UI into reusable components and emphasizing incremental adoption.\n\nWhile it's certainly still a library that can be [sprinkled into any webpage](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/add-react-to-a-website), the **React architecture** is a blueprint for frameworks to follow to create interactive, resilient, and performant [frontend patterns](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/37).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`React has evolved from a library to also provide an architecture for frameworks.`}\n  src={`/images/react-frameworks/evolving.jpg`}\n  width={1456 / 2}\n  height={819 / 2}\n/>\n\nConsider [React Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components). This architecture is designed for frameworks to implement. Some aspects have been standardized between React frameworks (e.g. [\"use client\"](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/227)) and others are being incubated (e.g. [async/await in Server Components](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/229)) during [beta periods](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#new-app-directory-beta). Frameworks can still choose their own conventions (e.g. [special filenames](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/fundamentals#special-files)).\n\nImplementing the React architecture, and ultimately great UI patterns, requires deep integration between all parts of your frontend: data fetching and loading states, code splitting and bundling, routing and rendering, and more.\n\nThis is where frameworks come in.\n\n<StaticTweet id=\"1585076899126345728\" />\n_P.S. I talked about this evolution during the [Reactathon keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XruemT74Nok&list=PLRvKvw42Rc7O0eWo2m_guXdZsGTEQM_jj)._\n\n## Less time connecting tools, more time building products\n\nReact has been around for almost [10 years](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)>) – and the web has grown with it.\n\nEvery aspect of frontend development has seen innovation: linting, formatting, compiling, bundling, minifying, deploying, and more. Developers want to spend less time configuring their tooling and more time writing React code, while still taking advantage of these latest advancements.\n\nTeams who build with React frameworks can focus on components and business logic, and lean on battle-tested open-source solutions for routing, rendering, data fetching, styling, authentication, testing, and more.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`An iceberg of react frameworks, showing that while most of the time it seems it's just components and business logic, the reality is that under water there are many other things frameworks are handling for you, like authentication, rendering, routing, state management, i18n, styling, and more.`}\n  src={`/images/react-frameworks/iceberg.png`}\n  width={2478 / 3}\n  height={2784 / 3}\n/>\n\nFurther, teams can [update to the latest versions](https://vercel.com/blog/upgrading-nextjs-for-instant-performance-improvements) of these frameworks and instantly receive both performance benefits and new tools to help them improve the end-user experience. In some cases, you [add a command line flag](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1607461222584291328) and take advantage of multi-year and multi-million dollar investments into [Rust-based JavaScript tooling](https://leerob.io/blog/rust). It's harder to justify investments into developer experience and tooling when building an internal framework (for most teams).\n\n## Easier onboarding and training of new developers\n\nFrameworks help you [spend more time writing React code](https://twitter.com/getDanArias/status/1607727505217294341).\n\nCompiling, bundling, minifying, code splitting, server-rendering, routing – by using a framework, your team spends less time building and maintaining solutions that are solved problems.\n\nFor example, [moving from React + Express + Webpack to a framework](https://vercel.com/blog/migrating-a-large-open-source-react-application-to-next-js-and-vercel) resulted in removing **20,000+ lines of code** and **30+ dependencies** – while improving HMR (Hot Module Reloading) from **1.3s to 131ms**.\n\nCompanies who choose to build with open-source React frameworks benefit from:\n\n- **Immediate knowledge ramp-up:** New engineers can ship code on day one, bringing existing knowledge of popular frameworks from their last role or hobby projects.\n- **Up-to-date documentation:** When developers are stuck, they're able to reference documentation that's updated daily or [easily search Stack Overflow for their stack trace](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1605997497976885248)².\n- **Best-in-class security:** Bugs and security vulnerabilities are reported and patched by communities of [thousands of developers](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1604880119666905088) instead of overworked platform teams.\n\nMeta (the creators of React) have their own closed-source web framework. Many innovations in React have come from years of dogfooding new features (like [Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components)) on [Facebook.com](http://facebook.com/) through this framework.\n\nUsing an open-source React framework, built on top of the latest React UI primitives, is the closest way to emulate the tools developers at Facebook use to build one of the largest web applications in the world.\n\n## Flexibility for different rendering strategies\n\nReact, by itself, is primarily used on the client (in the browser).\n\nIn a standard React application, the browser receives an empty HTML shell from the server along with JavaScript instructions to construct the UI. This is called [client-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/client-and-server) because the initial rendering work happens on the user's device.\n\nWhile this is a valid pattern for certain types of applications (especially those behind a login), React's widespread usage for any type of web page made developers also want to [prerender](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering) content from the server. The HTML is generated in advance rather than computed on the user's device.\n\nSending HTML from the server (or how most sites work) can provide some benefits:\n\n1.  It's typically faster to do expensive work on a powerful server than on a user's device.\n2.  It's a better user experience to see more content on the initial paint versus a loading spinner.\n3.  It's a better user experience when running A/B tests or experiments, preventing layout shifts.\n\nReact does give you [APIs to render content to HTML](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream), which might work for your use case. However, the developer is still left with connecting many pieces together for the rest of the application experience. This is where frameworks provide a cohesive experience on top of React when you need to prerender content.\n\nIt might sound like all React apps should be server-rendered. The reality is, of course, more nuanced. For certain routes, it's likely better to generate a static asset and distribute it around the world using an [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/overview) (placing the assets closer to your users).\n\nFor other pages, the client-only model might be better. You can download the JavaScript for the page _once_, cache the assets on the device (which have a unique hash in the file name for the given version), and then quickly navigate between pages (giving you the single-page application feel). This might be a better solution for applications that require offline support.\n\nThere's no silver bullet or single rendering strategy that works. Static, server, or client rendered – all are valid options depending on the requirements. Frameworks can empower you to make this decision on a per-route basis, rather than needing to make the _entire_ application a static site or server-rendered.\n\n## Opinionated choices prevent bikeshedding\n\nPicking React is **one decision** of _many_ frontend architecture choices.\n\nYou will likely also need to consider:\n\n- How should we handle routing? (i.e. using the file system or through some configuration)\n- How should we only load the JavaScript needed for the current page? (i.e. code splitting)\n- How should we prevent regressions in our codebase? (e.g. using conformance and linting)\n- How should we load data for a given page? (i.e. server or client)\n- How should we deploy our React application? (e.g. using Docker, Node.js, or static files)\n- How should we style our code? (e.g. CSS modules, Tailwind CSS, etc.)\n- How should we handle authentication?\n\nFrameworks make many of these decisions for you, as well as provide you with tools and components to solve common problems on the web. For example, you will probably need to use [images](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization), [fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization), or [third-party scripts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script) when building a website. Frameworks can give you tools to help optimize your usage of these primitives, building on top of [React, JavaScript, and the web platform](https://leerob.substack.com/p/why-im-optimistic-about-javascripts).\n\nBuilding with an open-source framework that's well adopted gives you access to many contributors creating, maintaining, and documenting common issues – codifying them into conformance rules and [ESLint configurations](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint#eslint-config). There are sometimes even suggestions built into common web performance measurement tools like [Lighthouse](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1506332606371086338).\n\nIt's important for frameworks to be opinionated, but still have ways to eject or give access to the underlying primitives to allow developers to not feel a loss of control. For example, maybe this is a [robust plugin system](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#plugins), or maybe this is running [arbitrary routing logic before each request](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware).\n\n## Deploy anywhere and incrementally adopt\n\nIt's not uncommon to have internal platform teams supporting the delivery of bespoke React applications at larger companies. Since their tooling is not built on established, open platforms, developers often end up wasting time working on solved infrastructure problems.\n\nOne of the benefits of using a framework is that they all have support for either self-hosting on your own infrastructure (either through Docker, Node.js, or other means like uploading static assets) or by using [managed platforms](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1583529921153900545), which automate every process of the [iteration](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/20/vercel-makes-it-easier-to-collaborate-on-preview-deployments) and delivery of the software.\n\nAdditionally, many React frameworks have extensive documentation on how to incrementally adopt their tool, including providing low-level features like [URL proxies](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware), allowing you to rewrite some incoming requests to your new framework to your existing application.\n\n## It's still just React\n\nWhile frameworks provide abstractions and opinionated choices, at the end of the day, you spend the majority of your time writing React code. And that React code is portable between other React-based frameworks. This optionality is great for developers.\n\nFurther, React frameworks are increasingly aligned with the [web platform](https://leerob.substack.com/p/why-im-optimistic-about-javascripts). As patterns for building React applications have emerged and solidified, we're now seeing stronger recommendations from both the [official React documentation](https://beta.reactjs.org/), as well as frameworks and libraries in the community.\n\nWhile the innovation in the React and single-page application space has been abundant, we're now seeing frameworks use the best of the client, and the best of the server, all while taking full advantage of the web platform.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReact has evolved. It's now a:\n\n- **Library:** Sprinkle interactivity into any webpage\n- **Architecture:** UI patterns and primitives for frameworks to build with\n- **Community:** Well used and documented, incrementally adoptable\n- **Ecosystem:** Learn once, write everywhere (web, [native](https://reactnative.dev/), [3D](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction), and more)\n\nIf you're building with React, **you should probably use a framework** to spend more time writing product code, and less time connecting toolchains. The specific framework you use doesn't matter as much as the benefits from not reinventing the wheel building your own.\n\n---\n\n¹: The two React frameworks in the 6% were Next.js and Gatsby.

      "raw": "\nReact was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that **your UI was a function of your state**. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will look like. React is _built_ upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the most difficult parts of building a React application.\n\nLet's imagine state management in React as a rugged tool belt. You've used this tool belt for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You don't use your hammer to screw in bolts. As a craftsman, you've learned the right time and place to use each tool.\n\n**State management with React is a rugged tool belt, but not everyone has the prior experience to know which tool to reach for.** This post will explain the past, present, and future of state management to help you make the correct decision for your team, project, or organization.\n\n## Glossary\n\nBefore we begin, it's critical you understand some of the terms commonly used. These aren't the canonical names. A few different variations of each float around, but the underlying ideas are the same:\n\n- UI State – State used for controlling interactive parts of our application (e.g. dark mode toggle, modals).\n- Server Cache State – State from the server, which we cache on the client-side for quick access (e.g. call an API, store the result, use it in multiple places).\n- Form State – The many different states of a form (e.g. loading, submitting, disabled, validation, retrying). There's also [controlled & uncontrolled form state](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).\n- URL State – State managed by the browser (e.g. filter products, saving to query parameters, and refreshing the page to see the same products filtered)\n- State Machine – An explicit model of your state over time (e.g. a stoplight goes from green → yellow → red, but never green → red).\n\n## Past\n\nReact's component model helped create reusable, composable applications. Each component had its own local state. As web apps became more complex, new solutions emerged to more easily share logic between components.\n\n### Timeline\n\nTo help you understand how state management has evolved over time, here's a rough timeline of popular state management solutions in React. This list is heavily focused on UI State. This list is not comprehensive, but is enough to give context.\n\n- 2013 – Introduction\n- 2014 – Flux (many libraries)\n- 2015 – Redux\n- 2016 – MobX\n- 2018 – Context\n- 2019 – Hooks Introduced (+ React Query, SWR)\n- 2019 – Zustand\n- 2019 – xState\n- 2020 – Jotai, Recoil, Valtio\n- 2021 – useSelectedContext\n\nJust because an item is listed on this timeline does not mean you need to learn it. More on this later. Let's dive into the history of state management in React.\n\n### Redux\n\n[Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) was originally created as an implementation of the \"[Flux Architecture](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/#redux-was-built-as-a-flux-architecture-implementation)\", which was a pattern first suggested by Facebook in 2014. Redux came out in 2015 and quickly became the most popular of many Flux-inspired libraries. It's ecosystem of tools and libraries encapsulated both UI state and server caching state. **Redux is still extremely popular and widely used.**\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Redux Growth`}\n  src={`/images/react-state-management/redux.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={586}\n/>\n\n### Server Caching State\n\nIn the early days of React, lots of state management boiled down to fetching data from APIs and caching it for use across the application. The community leaned heavily on libraries like Redux because there wasn't an easy, widely used way to manage _just_ the server cache state.\n\nWith the release of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html), encapsulating logic into shared hooks became much easier and accessible. Libraries like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) emerged to solve this problem specifically.\n\nYou might think \"Why have a separate library just for server caching state?\". Well, **caching is hard**. Server caching state solves different problems than UI state. Here's a shortlist of some of the things these libraries handle for you:\n\n- Polling on interval\n- Revalidation on focus\n- Revalidation on network recovery\n- Local mutation (Optimistic UI)\n- Smart error retrying\n- Pagination and scroll position recovery\n\nDo you want to implement those yourself? _Probably not._\n\n### React Context\n\nWith [v16.3](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html), React Context gave us a first-party solution to share logic between components. This also prevented passing values down as props through multiple levels of nested components (i.e. \"[prop-drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling)\").\n\nReact Context itself is [not state management](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/). It can, however, [be paired with hooks](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react) like `useReducer` to become a state management solution. This combination solved UI state for many common use cases.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`React Context`}\n  src={`/images/react-state-management/context.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={572}\n/>\n\n## Present\n\nIn 2021, there are various ways to handle state management in React. As the community has grown to understand the different types of state, more granular libraries have been created solving very specific use cases.\n\n### State Machines\n\nLet's consider a switch statement. If the value of `state` matches any `case`, the corresponding code runs. There's a finite set of cases. This is the most simple state machine – an explicit model of your state.\n\n```jsx\nswitch (state) {\n  case state === 'loading':\n    // show loading spinner\n    break;\n  case state === 'success':\n    // show success message\n    break;\n  default:\n  // show error message\n}\n```\n\n[Finite State Machines](https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#finite-state-machines) and [Statecharts](https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#statecharts) are fundamental Computer Science concepts, so this isn't anything React specific. You can turn [`useReducer`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) into a state machine without any third-party libraries.\n\nState Machines are well-adopted everywhere, including databases, electronics, cars, and more. As state management evolved in the React ecosystem, we realized these old ideas could solve modern state management issues. State Machines are most prevalent for solving form state.\n\nWith a Finite State Machine, you have a finite number of states your application or component could be in. In practice, State Machines help you uncover bugs as you're required to think through and define edge cases. For much more information on this, I'd recommend checking out the [xState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) docs or watching [this course](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate). You can also [visualize entire state machines online](https://xstate.js.org/viz/).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`State Machines`}\n  src={`/images/react-state-management/state-machines.gif`}\n  width={800}\n  height={277}\n/>\n\n### Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, Valtio, Oh My!\n\nWhy do so many different libraries for React state management even exist?\n\nLet's consider Figma (or any other design tool). You have a toolbar of controls that affect other elements outside of its \"local\" state, or where the component is rendered.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Figma`}\n  src={`/images/react-state-management/figma.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={663}\n/>\n\nAs you can imagine, an application of this scale would require a complex state management solution. Performance and frame rate are critical for a good user experience here, so you want control over when & how to re-render. Unique use cases like this have led to lots of exploration in the state management space.\n\nTo summarize the differences between these libraries, let's hear from [Daishi Kato](https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1348257768130560008):\n\n- **Valtio** uses proxies to provide a mutation-style API\n- **Jotai** is optimized for \"computed values\" and async actions\n- **Zustand** is a very thin library specifically focused on module state\n- **Recoil** is an experimental library using a data-flow graph\n\nHaving complex state doesn't necessarily mean you _have_ to pull for a third-party library. You can start with React and JavaScript and see how far it takes you. If optimizing requires a state management library, you can track that metric (e.g. frame rate), measure it, and verify it solves a real problem.\n\n**Don't choose one of these libraries unless there's an obvious need.**\n\n### Immutable State\n\nAnother debate is mutable vs. immutable state. There's no right answers, just opinions. If you were doing state management with vanilla JavaScript, you'll likely have mutable state. You initialize a variable, and then later set it equal to some new value. There are [entire debates](https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/) on `let` vs. `const`.\n\nImmutable state gained a lot of popularity with React. The immutable crowd argues that allowing your state management solution of choice to mutate state directly results in more bugs. The mutable crowd argues it's not worth the complexity trade-off. Direct manipulation will always be less safe than indirect manipulation. It's a tradeoff between convenience and risk, which is up to you and your team.\n\nSolutions like [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) allow you to write mutable code but _execute_ it immutably. Fancy. The basic idea is you apply your changes to a _draft state_, which is a proxy of the _current state_. Once the mutations have completed Immer will produce the _next state_ based on the changes to the draft state.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Immer Immutable State`}\n  src={`/images/react-state-management/immer.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={389}\n/>\n\n### URL State\n\nLet's say you're building an e-commerce website like Amazon. You search for React books and filter by 4+ stars. This state is persisted as query parameters and managed by the browser. When you refresh the page, you see the same list of products. You can share this URL with others and they also see the same results.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Amazon URL State`}\n  src={`/images/react-state-management/amazon.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={732}\n/>\n\nAnother interesting example of this is Nomad List. We can transform the browser URL state into a function of our data. Plus, we can make human-readable URLs (which Google prefers).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Nomad List URL State`}\n  src={`/images/react-state-management/nomad.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={676}\n/>\n\n### Future\n\nFor large applications, it's possible a naive Context-based state management solutions (e.g. with `useReducer`) could have issues with excessive re-rendering. When a context value changes, all components that `useContext` will re-render. This makes UI interactions feel slow and janky. If you can't visually notice it, you can [use React Dev Tools](https://brycedooley.com/debug-react-rerenders/) to investigate re-rendering.\n\nThe React team has proposed a `useSelectedContext` hook to prevent performance issues with Context at scale. This [RFC was introduced](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119) in July 2019 and [progress has started](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20646) as of January 2021 behind a feature flag. This hook allows you to select a \"slice\" of Context and only re-render when that piece changes.\n\nThere are ways to work around re-rendering performance already (e.g. `useMemo`) but a first-party solution for Context is preferred. There's also a community library [useContextSelector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector), which takes a similar approach ([demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontextselector-demo-sixdr?file=/src/App.js)). [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) and [Formik 3](https://formik.org/blog/formik-3-alpha) use this under the hood. Having `useSelectedContext` as part of the React standard library will eliminate complexity and code size in external libraries, as well as provide more performant options by default.\n\nIn the longer-term future, React will automatically figure out which components to re-render (\"[auto-memoization](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119#issuecomment-586390430)\").\n\n## State Management Options\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list. It's also open-source, so please open a PR if you disagree or if something is wrong. In general, lean on whatever empowers your developers and team. **Happy with Redux? Stay there!**\n\n### Form State\n\n| Experience   | Learning Appetite | Project/Team Size | Solution                          |\n| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |\n| Beginner     | Low               | Small             | useState                          |\n| Beginner     | Medium            | Medium, Small     | Form Library (Formik, Final Form) |\n| Beginner     | High, Medium      | Large             | Ask your tech lead                |\n| Intermediate | Low               | Medium, Small     | Form Library (Formik, Final Form) |\n| Advanced     | Medium            | Medium            | State Machines                    |\n| Advanced     | High              | Medium            | State Machines                    |\n| Advanced     | High              | Large             | State Machines                    |\n\n### UI State\n\n| Experience   | Learning Appetite | Project/Team Size | Solution                             |\n| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| Beginner     | Low               | Small             | useState                             |\n| Beginner     | Medium            | Medium, Small     | useContext + useReducer              |\n| Beginner     | High, Medium      | Large             | Ask your tech lead                   |\n| Intermediate | Low               | Medium, Small     | Redux Toolkit                        |\n| Advanced     | Medium            | Medium            | useContext + useReducer              |\n| Advanced     | High              | Medium            | Jotai, Valtio                        |\n| Advanced     | High              | Large             | Recoil (or Relay if you use GraphQL) |\n\n### Server Cache State\n\nRegardless of experience or team size, both [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) and [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) are excellent solutions. You'll be happy with either.

It's one of the most difficult, nuanced parts of building large web applications. Understanding the different types of state and their trade-offs is crucial for making an informed decision.

      "raw": "\nOne metric for a website's success is the amount of traffic it receives.\nFor a blog, this translates to page views. Articles with lots of views indicate the content your readers care most about.\nThis helps drive future articles.\n\nMost people measure view counts via analytics (like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)).\nHowever, with the rise of ad-blocking browser extensions, these counts are likely [~10% off](https://moz.com/blog/analytics-black-holes) (especially if your target market is tech).\nWhat if we could have better accuracy, better performance, and better privacy for our users?\n\nThis post will show how to display real-time view counts for a given blog post using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).\nWe can host and deploy this entire solution **for free** using Firebase's [free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com).\n\n## Setting Up Firebase\n\n1.  If you do not have a Firebase account, create one first.\n2.  Create a new project.\n3.  Navigate to \"Database\" and click \"Create Database\".\n    <Image\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\n      src={`/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step1.png`}\n      width={1000}\n      height={534}\n    />\n4.  Start in test mode and click next.\n    <Image\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\n      src={`/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step2.png`}\n      width={1000}\n      height={533}\n    />\n5.  Choose your database location and click done.\n    <Image\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\n      src={`/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step3.png`}\n      width={1000}\n      height={532}\n    />\n6.  In the top left, click on \"Project Settings\".\n    <Image\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\n      src={`/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step4.png`}\n      width={979}\n      height={386}\n    />\n7.  Navigate to \"Service Accounts\" tab and click \"Generate new private key\". Save the `.json` file. You will need this later.\n    <Image\n      alt={`Create Firebase Database`}\n      src={`/images/real-time-post-views/firebase/step5.png`}\n      width={1000}\n      height={535}\n    />\n\nWe're finished! 🎉 You have successfully set up a realtime database, as well as generated credentials to connect to the database.\n\n## Connecting To Firebase\n\nFirst, we need to install the `firebase-admin` server-side SDK.\n\n```bash\nyarn add firebase-admin\n```\n\nNext, we need to create an `.env.local` file to add the values for the Firebase service account `.json` file.\nSpecifically, `private_key`, `project_id`, and `client_email`.\n\n```bash title=\".env\"\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=replace-me\nFIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=replace-me\nFIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=\"replace-me\"\n```\n\nMake sure you include the quotes around \"replace-me\" for `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`.\n\nYou will need to restart your application to load new environment variables.\nCreate a new file `lib/firebase.js` to initialize the application and establish a connection.\n\n```js title=\"lib/firebase.js\"\nimport * as admin from 'firebase-admin';\n\nif (!admin.apps.length) {\n  admin.initializeApp({\n    credential: admin.credential.cert({\n      projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,\n      clientEmail: process.env.FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL,\n      privateKey: process.env.FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY.replace(/\\\\n/g, '\\n'),\n    }),\n  });\n}\n\nconst db = admin.firestore();\n\nexport { db };\n```\n\n## Tracking Views\n\nTo track a view, we need to look at the database for `views -> id`. Let's create a new [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)\nto communicate with our database and increment the views for a given `id`.\n\n[API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) provide a straight-forward solution for building an API inside Next.js.\nAll you need to get started is an `api/` folder inside your main `pages/` folder where your routes live. Every file inside `pages/api/` is mapped to `/api/*`.\n\n```js title=\"pages/api/views/[slug].js\"\nimport { db } from '../../lib/firebase';\n\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    const ref = db.ref('views').child(req.query.slug);\n    const { snapshot } = await ref.transaction((currentViews) => {\n      if (currentViews === null) {\n        return 1;\n      }\n\n      return currentViews + 1;\n    });\n\n    return res.status(200).json({\n      total: snapshot.val(),\n    });\n  }\n};\n```\n\nFor an API route to work, you need to export a default function (i.e., **request handler**), which receives the following parameters:\n\n- `req`: An instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), plus some [pre-built middlewares](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares).\n- `res`: An instance of [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), plus some [helper functions](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/response-helpers).\n\n## Testing View Counts\n\nUsing your favorite REST client or your browser, you can now hit `http://localhost:3000/api/views/my-blog` to log a view.\nWe can confirm it was logged correctly by checking Firebase.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Testing Firebase`}\n  src={`/images/real-time-post-views/testing-database.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={562}\n/>\n\n## Fetching Data from Firebase\n\n[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) is a React Hooks library for remote data fetching.\nSWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.\n\nThis will allow us to fetch view counts from Firebase.\nIf you re-focus or switch between tabs, SWR will [automatically revalidate data](https://swr.now.sh/#focus-revalidation).\n\nLet's install SWR now.\n\n```bash\nyarn add swr\n```\n\nNext, we need to update our API Route to fetch the views for a given post.\n\n```js title=\"pages/api/views/[slug].js\"\nimport { db } from '../../lib/firebase';\n\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    const ref = db.ref('views').child(req.query.slug);\n    const { snapshot } = await ref.transaction((currentViews) => {\n      if (currentViews === null) {\n        return 1;\n      }\n\n      return currentViews + 1;\n    });\n\n    return res.status(200).json({\n      total: snapshot.val(),\n    });\n  }\n\n  if (req.method === 'GET') {\n    const snapshot = await db.ref('views').child(req.query.slug).once('value');\n    const views = snapshot.val();\n\n    return res.status(200).json({ total: views });\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## View Counter\n\nLet's create a `ViewCounter` component to use SWR.\n\n```jsx title=\"components/ViewCounter.js\"\nimport { useEffect } from 'react';\nimport useSWR from 'swr';\n\nasync function fetcher(...args) {\n  const res = await fetch(...args);\n\n  return res.json();\n}\n\nexport default function ViewCounter({ slug }) {\n  const { data } = useSWR(`/api/views/${slug}`, fetcher);\n  const views = new Number(data?.total);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const registerView = () =>\n      fetch(`/api/views/${slug}`, {\n        method: 'POST',\n      });\n\n    registerView();\n  }, [slug]);\n\n  return `${views > 0 ? views.toLocaleString() : '–––'} views`;\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we can consume the view counter in our blog post and pass in the ID.\n\n```jsx\n<ViewCounter slug=\"my-post\" />\n```\n\n## Deployment with Vercel\n\nWhen adding your Firebase private key inside the Vercel dashboard, ensure that you\nconvert new line characters (`\\n`) to actual new lines. For example, here's a fake private key.\n\n```bash\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----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\nIlpxVgdxp5tb9JOG3aoMMg==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n```\n\nNote the extra new line at the end.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou can view a completed example by checking out [this blog post's source code](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).\nI was able to migrate my page views from Google Analytics into Firebase via their web interface.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Blog Post Views`}\n  src={`/images/real-time-post-views/blog-post-views.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={599}\n/>\n\n**Note**: If your site receives a lot of traffic, you'll need to upgrade from the Spark plan (free) to Blaze (pay-as-you-go).\nOn Spark, you can only have 100 simultaneous connections.

      "raw": "\n[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a fast, reliable, and memory-efficient programming language. It's been voted the most loved programming language [six](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) [years](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) [in](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages) [a](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages) [row](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) ([survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)). Created by Mozilla, it's now used at [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/04/29/developer-tools/rust/), [Apple](https://twitter.com/oskargroth/status/1301502690409709568), [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/why-aws-loves-rust-and-how-wed-like-to-help/), [Microsoft](https://twitter.com/ryan_levick/status/1171830191804551168), and [Google](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html) for systems infrastructure, encryption, virtualization, and more low-level programming.\n\nWhy is Rust now being used to replace parts of the JavaScript web ecosystem like minification (Terser), transpilation (Babel), formatting (Prettier), bundling (webpack), linting (ESLint), and more?\n\n> Note: This post is also available in [Chinese](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzkxNDIzNTg4MA==&mid=2247485792&idx=1&sn=682a4dee7ce4d3b47a81baf9ebd7a98a&chksm=c170c1e7f60748f17585d6bfca0cff6edbf71bab95f0a4a1ea0bcf2d43c16d1722666d9fadc1&token=1766743281&lang=zh_CN#rd), [Portuguese](https://codigofonte.com.br/artigos/rust-e-o-futuro-da-infraestrutura-javascript), [Vietnamese](https://www.alanphan.xyz/vi/rush), and [Arabic](https://www.tutomena.com/rust-and-javascript/).\n\n## What is Rust?\n\nRust helps developers write fast software that's memory-efficient. It's a modern replacement for languages like C++ or C with a focus on code safety and concise syntax.\n\nRust is quite different than JavaScript. JavaScript tries to find variables or objects not in use and automatically clears them from memory. This is called [Garbage Collection](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>). The language abstracts the developer from thinking about manual memory management.\n\nWith Rust, developers have more control over memory allocation, without it being as painful as C++.\n\n> Rust uses a relatively unique memory management approach that incorporates the idea of memory “ownership”. Basically, Rust keeps track of who can read and write to memory. It knows when the program is using memory and immediately frees the memory once it is no longer needed. It enforces memory rules at compile time, making it virtually impossible to have runtime memory bugs. You do not need to manually keep track of memory. The compiler takes care of it. – [Discord](https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)\n\n## Adoption\n\nOn top of the companies mentioned above, Rust is also being used for popular open-source libraries like:\n\n- [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) (AWS)\n- [Bottlerocket](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket) (AWS)\n- [Quiche](https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche) (Cloudflare)\n- [Neqo](https://github.com/mozilla/neqo) (Mozilla)\n\n> Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on correctness has helped us tame sync's complexity. We can encode complex invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them for us. – [Dropbox](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine)\n\n## From JavaScript to Rust\n\nJavaScript is the most widely used programming language, operating on every device with a web browser. Over the past ten years, a massive ecosystem has been built around JavaScript:\n\n- **Webpack:** developers wanted to bundle multiple JavaScript files into one.\n- **Babel:** developers wanted to write modern JavaScript while supporting older browsers.\n- **Terser:** developers wanted to generate the smallest possible file sizes.\n- **Prettier:** developers wanted an opinionated code formatter that just worked.\n- **ESLint:** developers wanted to find issues with their code before deploying.\n\nMillions of lines of code have been written and even more bugs have been fixed to create the bedrock for shipping web applications of today. All of these tools are written with JavaScript or TypeScript. This has worked well, but we've reached peak optimization with JS. This has inspired a new class of tools, designed to drastically improve the performance of building for the web.\n\n### SWC\n\n[SWC](http://swc.rs/), created in 2017, is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools. It's used by tools like Next.js, Parcel, and Deno, as well as companies like Vercel, ByteDance, Tencent, Shopify, and more.\n\nSWC can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, and more – and is designed to be extended. It's something you can call to perform code transformations (either built-in or custom). Running those transformations happens through higher-level tools like Next.js.\n\n### Deno\n\n[Deno](https://deno.land/), created in 2018, is a simple, modern, and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses [V8](https://v8.dev/) and is built with Rust. It's an attempt to replace Node.js, written by the original creators of Node.js. While it was created in 2018, it didn't hit [v1.0 until May 2020](https://deno.com/blog/v1).\n\nDeno's linter, code formatter, and docs generator are [built using SWC](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000).\n\n### esbuild\n\n[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), created in January 2020, is a JavaScript bundler and minifier 10-100x faster than existing tools, written in Go.\n\n> I'm trying to create a build tool that A) works well for a given sweet spot of use cases (bundling JavaScript, TypeScript, and maybe CSS) and B) **resets the expectations of the community for what it means for a JavaScript build tool to be fast**. Our current tools are way too slow in my opinion. – Evan, Creator of esbuild ([Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336334))\n\nBuilding JavaScript tooling with systems programming languages, like Go and Rust, was fairly niche until esbuild was released. In my opinion, esbuild sparked a wider interest in trying to make developer tools faster. Evan chose to use Go:\n\n> The Rust version probably could be made to work at an equivalent speed with enough effort. But at a high level, Go was much more enjoyable to work with. This is a side project and it has to be fun for me to work on it. – Evan, Creator of esbuild ([Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22336284))\n\nSome argue Rust could perform better, but both could achieve Evan's original goal of influencing the community:\n\n> Even with just basic optimization, Rust was able to outperform the hyper hand-tuned Go version. This is a huge testament to how easy it is to write efficient programs with Rust compared to the deep dive we had to do with Go. – [Discord](https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-switching-from-go-to-rust-a190bbca2b1f)\n\n### Rome\n\n[Rome](https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome), created in August 2020, is a linter, compiler, bundler, test runner, and more, for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, JSON, Markdown, and CSS. They aim to replace and unify the entire frontend development toolchain. It's created by [Sebastian](https://twitter.com/sebmck), who also created Babel.\n\nWhy rewrite everything, then?\n\n> Making the necessary modifications to Babel to allow for it to be a reliable base for other tools would have required changes to absolutely everything. The architecture is bound to the initial design choices I made in 2014 when I was learning about parsers, ASTs, and compilers. - Sebastian ([Source](https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome))\n\nRome is currently written in TypeScript and runs on Node.js. But they're now working on [rewriting in Rust](https://rome.tools/blog/2021/09/21/rome-will-be-rewritten-in-rust) using RSLint parser and their own visitor system for AST traversal.\n\n### NAPI\n\nRust's integration with Node.js is better than other low-level languages.\n\n[napi-rs](https://napi.rs/) allows you to build pre-compiled Node.js add-ons with Rust. It provides an out-of-the-box solution for cross-compilation and publishing native binaries to NPM, without needing `node-gyp` or `postinstall` scripts.\n\nYou can build a Rust module that can be called directly from Node.js, without needing to create a child process like esbuild.\n\n## Rust + WebAssembly\n\n[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/) *(*WASM*)* is a portable low-level language that Rust can compile to. It runs in the browser, is interoperable with JavaScript, and is supported in all major modern browsers.\n\n> WASM is definitely a lot faster than JS, but not quite native speed. In our tests, Parcel runs 10-20x slower when compiled to WASM than with native binaries. – [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett)\n\nWhile WASM isn't the perfect solution yet, it _can_ help developers create extremely fast web experiences. The Rust team is [committed](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm) to a high-quality and cutting-edge WASM implementation. For developers, this means you could have the performance advantages of Rust (vs. Go) while still compiling for the web (using WASM).\n\nSome early libraries and frameworks in this space:\n\n- [Yew](https://yew.rs/)\n- [Percy](https://github.com/chinedufn/percy)\n- [Seed](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed)\n- [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore)\n- [Stork](https://stork-search.net/)\n\nThese Rust-based web frameworks that compile to WASM aren't trying to replace JavaScript, but work alongside it. While we aren't there yet, it's interesting to see Rust coming after the web on both sides: **making existing JavaScript tooling faster** _and_ **future-forward ideas for [compiling to WASM](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html)**.\n\nIt's Rust all the way down.\n\n## Why Not Rust?\n\nRust has a steep learning curve. It's a lower level of abstraction than what most web developers are used to.\n\nOnce you're on native code (through Rust, Go, Zig, or other low-level languages),\nthe algorithms and data structures are [more important](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1457945506332692482) than the language choice. It's not a silver bullet.\n\n> Rust makes you think about dimensions of your code that matter tremendously for systems programming. It makes you think about how memory is shared or copied. It makes you think about real but unlikely corner cases and make sure that they're handled. It helps you write code that's incredibly efficient in every possible way. – Tom MacWright ([Source](https://macwright.com/2021/01/15/rust.html))\n\nFurther, Rust's usage in the web community is still niche. It hasn't reached critical adoption. Even though learning Rust for JavaScript tooling will be a barrier to entry, interestingly developers would rather have a [faster tool that's harder to contribute to](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1261379312898306048). [Fast software wins](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/).\n\nCurrently, it's hard to find a Rust library or framework for your favorite services (things like working with authentication, databases, payments, and more). I do think that once Rust and WASM reach critical adoption, this will resolve itself. But not yet. **We need existing JavaScript tools to help us bridge the gap and incrementally adopt performance improvements**.\n\n## The Future of JavaScript Tooling\n\nI believe Rust is the future of JavaScript tooling. [Next.js 12](http://nextjs.org/12) started our transition to fully replace Babel (transpilation) and Terser (minification) with SWC and Rust. Why?\n\n- **Extensibility:** SWC can be used as a Crate inside Next.js, without having to fork the library or workaround design constraints.\n- **Performance:** We were able to achieve ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds in Next.js by switching to SWC, with more room for optimization still in progress.\n- **WebAssembly:** Rust's support for WASM is essential for supporting all possible platforms and taking Next.js development everywhere.\n- **Community:** The Rust community and ecosystem are amazing and only growing.\n\nIt's not just Next.js adopting SWC, either:\n\n- [Deno's](https://deno.land/) linter, code formatter, and docs generator are [built using SWC](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1369033422002389000).\n- [dprint](https://github.com/devongovett/dprint-node), built on SWC, is a [30x faster](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1400138335721455617) code formatting replacement for Prettier.\n- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) improved overall build performance by [up to 10x](https://v2.parceljs.org/blog/beta3/) with SWC.\n\n> Parcel uses SWC like a library. Before we used Babel's parser and custom transforms written in JS. Now, we use SWC's parser and [custom transforms in Rust](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/tree/v2/packages/transformers/js/core/src). This includes a full scope hoisting implementation, dependency collection, and more. It's similar in scope to how Deno built on top of SWC. – [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett)\n\nIt's early days for Rust – a few important pieces are still being figured out:\n\n- **Plugins:** Writing plugins in Rust isn't as approachable for many JavaScript developers. At the same time, exposing a plugin system in JavaScript could negate performance gains. A definitive solution hasn't emerged yet. Ideally, the future combines both JavaScript and Rust. If you want to write a plugin with JavaScript, it's possible with a tradeoff for speed. Need more performance? Use the Rust plugin API.\n- **Bundling:** One interesting area of development is `swcpack`, which is SWC's replacement for Webpack. It's still under development but could be very promising.\n- **WebAssembly:** As mentioned above, the prospect of writing Rust and compiling to WASM is enticing, but there's still work to be done.\n\n<Callout emoji=\"💡\">\n\n**Update 2023:** [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) has been released, the Rust-powered successor to Webpack.\n\n</Callout>\n\nRegardless, I'm confident Rust will continue to have a major impact on the JavaScript ecosystem for the next 1-2 years and into the future. Imagine a world where all of the build tools used in Next.js are written in Rust, giving you optimal performance. Then, Next.js could be distributed as a [static binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_build) you'd download from NPM.\n\nThat's the world I want to live (and develop) in.\n\n---\n\n_Thanks to [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett) for reviewing an early draft of this article._\n",

    "summary": "Did you know it's possible to use Redis for your entire database? Hashmaps, counters, sorted lists, and even queues. Learn how to deploy a Redis & Next.js app in a few short minutes.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nWhen front-end developers are learning the full-stack, they often stumble on which [backend to use](/blog/backend). If they hear Redis, they think of in-memory caching. That's what I thought, at least.\nAfter doing more research, I was surprised to find Redis excels at [hashmaps, counters, sorted lists, and even queues](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/take-advantage-of-redis-adding-it-to-your-stack.html). It's possible to use Redis for your entire database!\n\nThis article will explore using Redis with Next.js in Serverless environments.\n\n### Creating a Redis Instance\n\n[Upstash](https://upstash.com/) is the easiest way I've found to deploy a managed Redis instance. A few reasons I recommend it:\n\n- There's a generous free tier, and then per-request pricing when you're ready to upgrade. This keeps costs free (or extremely low). There's even a $120/month cap to prevent surprises, plus reserved plans for larger projects.\n- With Upstash, you can use Redis for more than just caching with durable storage. There's even [Strong Consistency](https://docs.upstash.com/docs/overall/consistency) mode for guaranteed, durable writes.\n- It's fast. Really, really fast. Extremely low latency.\n\nThe Upstash Integration for Vercel makes it easy to get started with Serverless Redis. We'll start by deploying the [completed project](https://roadmap-redis.vercel.app/), and then running the application locally.\n\n1. [Deploy the demo to Vercel using the Upstash Integration.](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-redis&project-name=redis-roadmap&repository-name=redis-roadmap&demo-title=Redis%20Roadmap&demo-description=Create%20and%20upvote%20features%20for%20your%20product.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Froadmap-redis.vercel.app%2F&integration-ids=oac_V3R1GIpkoJorr6fqyiwdhl17)\n2. You'll be prompted to sign-up or sign-in to Upstash.\n3. Then, you can create a free database and attach it to your Vercel project.\n4. Click \"Complete on Vercel\".\n5. That's it! You should have a deployed project and URL.\n\nBy default, both Vercel and Upstash use the `us-east-1` region for Serverless Functions. Using the same region is critical to minimize latency between your [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction) and Redis.\n\n### Connecting to Redis\n\nIf you're using Vercel, you can clone the git repository created during deployment.\nThe `REDIS_URL` environment variable was added by the Upstash Integration while deploying. To run the application locally, we'll need to pull our environment variables locally using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).\n\n```jsx\n$ vercel link\n$ vercel env pull .env.local\n```\n\nIf you're not using Vercel, you can clone this demo locally using `npx create-next-app --example with-redis roadmap`.\nThen, create an `.env.local` file in the root of your repository and add the Redis connection string.\n\n```jsx:.env.local\nREDIS_URL=redis://:password@endpoint:port\n```\n\nWe'll use [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis), a Node.js Redis client with [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) support, to connect to Redis.\n\n```jsx title=\"lib/redis.js\"\nimport Redis from 'ioredis';\n\nconst redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);\n\nexport default redis;\n```\n\nFinally, we can use this inside any page or API Route to retrieve information from Redis.\n\n```jsx\nimport redis from 'lib/redis';\n\nconst value = JSON.parse(await redis.hget('feedback', id));\n```\n\n### Using Redis with Next.js\n\nHere's a few common Redis commands you might need to use:\n\n- Fetching a JSON object: `redis.hget('feedback', id)`\n- Creating a JSON object: `redis.hset('feedback', id, \"{'key': 'val'}\")`\n- Deleting by key: `redis.hdel('feedback', id)`\n- Fetching a list of items: `redis.hvals('feedback')`\n\nIn the demo application, we use Redis for the following:\n\n1. The feature list is server-rendered using `getServerSideProps`. We fetch all features and sort based on the score and title.\n1. The initial feature list from the server populates the local cache of [SWR](swr.vercel.app). This ensures data remains up-to-date on the client-side.\n1. When adding features or emails, a `POST` request is sent to an [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to update Redis.\n1. Adding/upvoting features will mutate the client-side cache for [optimistic UI updates](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/mutation).\n\nYou can view the entire Redis API [here](https://redis.io/commands). For more advanced Redis usage, see the Redis API compatibility with Upstash [here](https://docs.upstash.com/docs/overall/rediscompatibility/).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI frequently need to store data, somewhere. It doesn't always need to be complex – a key/value store will often suffice.\nAfter working more with Upstash, Redis is now my preferred solution for this (and apparently [many other people's as well](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020-programming-language-framework-salary-data/)).\n\n- [View the demo ✨](https://roadmap-redis.vercel.app/)\n- [Deploy your own 🚀](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-redis&project-name=redis-roadmap&repository-name=redis-roadmap&demo-title=Redis%20Roadmap&demo-description=Create%20and%20upvote%20features%20for%20your%20product.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Froadmap-redis.vercel.app%2F&integration-ids=oac_V3R1GIpkoJorr6fqyiwdhl17)\n\n**Bonus:** If you need to inspect your Redis database locally, check out [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for a GUI and [redis-cli](https://docs.upstash.com/docs/overall/getstarted#connect-to-your-database) if you prefer the command-line.\n",

    "publishedAt": "2014-10-31",
    "summary": "Utilizing Python and PyGame to revive a classic.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nTo challenge my knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming, I created a clone of the classic arcade game [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) and added a modern twist. My goal for this project was to replicate the core gameplay of the original while enhancing the graphics and gameplay ever so slightly. I used a set of Python modules designed for writing games called [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news.html) to assist in the development. Prior to this project I had no experience using Pygame, so it was an exciting learning experience. You can view the full source code on my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/leerob/Space_Invaders).\n\n---\n\n### Design\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Space Invaders`}\n  src={`/images/space-invaders-with-python/space-invaders.png`}\n  width={795}\n  height={620}\n/>\n\nIf you've ever played Space Invaders, you'll notice all the familiar elements - the ship, invaders, blockers, score, and lives. The classic game features five rows of eleven enemies. For my clone, I decided to only use ten per row so the screen didn't feel too congested. To spice up the visuals from the original arcade game, I gave the enemies different colors to signify their point values. Also, rather than using a static black background, I chose to use an image of space for some extra flair. The final change from the original is the ship. Paying homage to the design from [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga), I transformed the ship into a stylish cruiser.\n\n### Gameplay\n\nSpace Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship with lasers by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of ten aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance towards the bottom of the screen. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up.\n\nThe aliens attempt to destroy the ship by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom, the alien invasion is successful and the game ends. A special \"mystery ship\" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed. The ship is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers that are gradually destroyed by projectiles from the aliens and player.\n\nI tried to keep the gameplay as similar to the original as I could. The enemies descend in the same fashion and animate between their two states to show movement. Instead of having the ship explode like in the original, I used a flickering death similar to other arcade games. I retained all the sounds from the original arcade version.\n\nYou can see an example of the gameplay [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2yUP3WMDRc) Enjoy 🎉\n\n### Resources\n\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news.html)\n- [Original Arcade Sounds](https://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders//sounds)\n- [Sprite Sheet](https://orig02.deviantart.net/3ed1/f/2009/242/f/4/space_invaders_sprite_sheet_by_gooperblooper22.png)\n- [Space Invaders Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders)\n",

    "title": "Using the Spotify API with Next.js",
    "publishedAt": "2020-07-21",
    "summary": "Learn how to authenticate with the Spotify API to fetch your top tracks in a Next.js API route.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nI wanted to display what song I'm currently listening to on my site, as well as my top tracks.\nTo accomplish this, I'd need to integrate [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) with Next.js [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).\nThis post will be a quick tutorial to get up and running with Spotify.\n\n## Create an Application\n\nFirst, we need to create a Spotify application to give us credentials to authenticate with the API.\n\n- Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log in.\n- Click **Create an App**.\n- Fill out the name and description and click **create**.\n- Click **Show Client Secret**.\n- Save your Client ID and Secret. You'll need these soon.\n- Click **Edit Settings**.\n- Add `http://localhost:3000` as a redirect URI.\n\nAll done! You now have a properly configured Spotify application and the correct credentials to make requests.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThere are a variety of ways to authenticate with the Spotify API, depending on your application. Since we only need permission granted _once_, we'll use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).\n\nFirst, we'll have our application request authorization by logging in with whatever [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes) we need.\nHere's an example of what the URL might look like.\nSwap out the `client_id` and scopes for your own.\n\n```bash\nhttps://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=8e94bde7dd\nb84a1f7a0e51bf3bc95be8&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http\n%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20\nuser-top-read\n```\n\nAfter authorizing, you'll be redirected back to your `redirect_uri`.\nIn the URL, there's a `code` query parameter. Save this value.\n\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:3000/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to retrieve the refresh token. You'll need to generate a Base 64 encoded string containing the client ID and secret from earlier. You can use [this tool](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode it online. The format should be `client_id:client_secret`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>\"\n-d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=<code> -d redirect_uri=http%3A\n%2F%2Flocalhost:3000 https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token\n```\n\nThis will return a JSON response containing a `refresh_token`. This token is [valid indefinitely](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/374) unless you revoke access, so we'll want to save this in an environment variable.\n\n## Using Spotify's API\n\nFinally, we can get some real data! Inside Next.js, create three new values in your `.env.local` file.\n\n```bash\nSPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=\nSPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=\nSPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=\n```\n\n**Note:** If you haven't worked with environment variables in Next before, [give this a read first](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).\n\nWe can now request an access token using our client ID, client secret, and `refresh_token`.\n\n```js title=\"lib/spotify.js\"\nimport querystring from 'querystring';\n\nconst client_id = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID;\nconst client_secret = process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET;\nconst refresh_token = process.env.SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN;\n\nconst basic = Buffer.from(`${client_id}:${client_secret}`).toString('base64');\nconst TOKEN_ENDPOINT = `https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token`;\n\nconst getAccessToken = async () => {\n  const response = await fetch(TOKEN_ENDPOINT, {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: `Basic ${basic}`,\n      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n    },\n    body: querystring.stringify({\n      grant_type: 'refresh_token',\n      refresh_token,\n    }),\n  });\n\n  return response.json();\n};\n```\n\nUse this `access_token` to securely request your top tracks.\nThis assumes you added the `user-top-read` scope at the beginning.\n\n```js title=\"lib/spotify.js\"\nconst TOP_TRACKS_ENDPOINT = `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks`;\n\nexport const getTopTracks = async () => {\n  const { access_token } = await getAccessToken();\n\n  return fetch(TOP_TRACKS_ENDPOINT, {\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`,\n    },\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### Creating an API Route\n\nLet's test our communication with Spotify.\nFirst, create a new file at `pages/api/top-tracks.js`.\nThen, import the new function `getTopTracks`.\n\n```js title=\"pages/api/top-tracks.js\"\nimport { getTopTracks } from '../../lib/spotify';\n\nexport default async (_, res) => {\n  const response = await getTopTracks();\n  const { items } = await response.json();\n\n  const tracks = items.slice(0, 10).map((track) => ({\n    artist: track.artists.map((_artist) => _artist.name).join(', '),\n    songUrl: track.external_urls.spotify,\n    title: track.name,\n  }));\n\n  return res.status(200).json({ tracks });\n};\n```\n\nThis will return the first ten top tracks, formatted to remove unnecessary information.\nFeel free to modify this as you see fit.\nIf everything worked correctly, you should see some data like this after running `next dev`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tracks\": [\n    {\n      \"artist\": \"Jamie xx\",\n      \"songUrl\": \"https://open.spotify.com/track/77Ezu3tBE7gmzQ4mRnZZUf\",\n      \"title\": \"The Rest Is Noise\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"artist\": \"Surfaces\",\n      \"songUrl\": \"https://open.spotify.com/track/0NjSiGW8b5HYFfjdCbZzbg\",\n      \"title\": \"Horizons\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe full source code is available [here](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/675ba074e873a85f1ee6a0d195f7d20312e62b4e/lib/spotify.ts).\n",

      "raw": "\nFor the better part of the last year, I've been investing heavily in front-end development and design.\nWhen I started my new role, I identified a need for a component library and created it.\nSince then, I've learned a lot about style guides, design systems, component libraries, and their best practices. This post will be a deep-dive on everything I've learned in the past year.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.

[Resources](/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems#resources)\n\n## Why Should You Care?\n\nEvery website starts simple. There's maybe one page with a few distinct pieces. It has modest intentions.\n\n<a aria-label=\"Website Mockup\" href=\"https://refactoringui.com/\">\n  <Image\n    alt={`Website Mockup`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/website.png`}\n    width={1467}\n    height={878}\n  />\n</a>\n\nThen, slowly, it begins to scale.\n\nMore pages are added and new features are built. There might even be multiple teams devoted to specific sections of the site. You could be developing for mobile, too.\n\nYou start to notice the buttons in one part of the site are slightly different than everywhere else. One team decides to build a feature that another team has (unknowingly) already completed. Communication breakdowns happen. Consistency is lost.\n\nIs this a preventable problem? Absolutely. Yet, why does it happen over and over again? **Unless you think about your design and development process upfront, you will run into issues later as you scale.**\n\nTo prevent this issue from happening, or to fix the existing lack of consistency in your products, you need three things:\n\n- **Style Guide**\n- **Component Library**\n- **Design System**\n\nDon't worry if you have no idea what I'm talking about yet. By the end of this article, you'll have consumed almost a year's worth of trial & error, research, and development.\n\n## What Is a Style Guide?\n\n<a\n  aria-label=\"Style Guide\"\n  href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/6161977-BlueVine-Product-Style-Guide\"\n>\n  <Image\n    alt={`Style Guide`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/style-guide.png`}\n    width={1468}\n    height={1101}\n  />\n</a>\n\nA **style guide** is a set of rules for how your brand should be displayed. This is both visual (design & imagery) as well as written content (voice & tone).\n\nThe purpose of a style guide is to **allow multiple contributors to create content clearly that cohesively represents the brand**. Almost every major brand has a style guide, though not all are public.\n\n## What is a Component Library?\n\n<a aria-label=\"Component Library\" href=\"https://eva.design/\">\n  <Image\n    alt={`Component Library`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/components.png`}\n    width={1000}\n    height={376}\n  />\n</a>\n\nA **component library** is living, breathing implementation of your style guide. It's a shared set of UI components that developers can consume to build applications reflecting your brand. Some notable benefits:\n\n- Having a component library means less custom code for consumers.\n- Since there's a central location, you can ensure all components meet accessibility requirements.\n- Components become more robust with multiple contributors submitting bug fixes and improvements in a single place.\n- Less duplication of code allows you to ship new products and rewrite legacy code faster.\n\n## What is a Design System?\n\nA **design system** is a complete set of standards, documentation, and principles along with the components to achieve those standards. It is the **marriage between your style guide and component library**. One of the most popular design systems is Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/design/).\n\n<a\n  aria-label=\"Design System\"\n  href=\"https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/design-systems-vs-pattern-libraries-vs-style-guides-whats-difference/\"\n>\n  <Image\n    alt={`Design System`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/design-system.png`}\n    width={1400}\n    height={900}\n  />\n</a>\n\nA design system should contain:\n\n- **Content** -- The language to design a more thoughtful product experience.\n- **Design** -- The visual elements of the design system.\n- **Components** -- The building blocks for developing new products and features.\n- **Patterns** -- The individual pieces for creating meaningful product experiences.\n\n## Where Should You Begin?\n\nDepending on the state of your company/product, you might have a different starting point. This is the outline before we dive into specifics.\n\n- Create an inventory of existing design patterns.\n- Establish design principles and begin a style guide.\n- Define your design tokens.\n- Create or identify an icon set.\n- Choose languages/frameworks supported.\n- Evaluate Monorepo vs. single package.\n- Evaluate CSS/Sass vs. CSS-in-JS.\n- Create a component library.\n- Choose a documentation platform.\n- Write design system documentation.\n\n## Building the Design System\n\n### Create an inventory of existing design patterns.\n\nUnless you are starting from scratch, you will need to identify all the design patterns currently in use in your interface and document any inconsistencies.\nThe goal should be the same user experience regardless of which part of the product the user is in.\n\nStart documenting and reviewing these amongst your team and identifying your preferred interaction patterns.\nThis should start to paint a picture of which pieces your style guide will need.\n\n### Establish design principles and begin a style guide.\n\nIt's time to translate these findings into the beginnings of a style guide. You can use tools like:\n\n- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)\n- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)\n- [Framer](https://www.framer.com/)\n- [Abobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)\n\nMy recommendation would be **Figma**, but it's ultimately up to your team and company. Here's some helpful [Figma for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4) tutorials.\n\n### Define your design tokens.\n\n<a aria-label=\"Design Tokens\" href=\"https://www.antforfigma.com/\">\n  <Image\n    alt={`Design Tokens`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/design-tokens.png`}\n    width={1080}\n    height={810}\n  />\n</a>\n\n> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system --- specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.\n\nThis includes things like:\n\n- [Colors](https://colors.eva.design/) (text, backgrounds, borders)\n- [Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)\n- [Typography sizes](http://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/)\n- [Spacing values](https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632)\n- [Shadows](https://material.io/design/environment/light-shadows.html)\n\nFor example, take a look at [Vercel's Design System](https://vercel.com/design).\n\n```css\n--geist-foreground: #000;\n--geist-background: #fff;\n--accents-1: #fafafa;\n--accents-2: #eaeaea;\n--accents-3: #999999;\n--accents-4: #888888;\n--accents-5: #666666;\n--accents-6: #444444;\n--accents-7: #333333;\n--accents-8: #111111;\n--geist-success: #0070f3;\n--geist-error: #ee0000;\n--geist-warning: #f5a623;\n--dropdown-box-shadow: 0 4px 4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02);\n--dropdown-triangle-stroke: #fff;\n--scroller-start: var(--geist-background);\n--scroller-end: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\n--shadow-small: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);\n--shadow-medium: 0 8px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);\n--shadow-large: 0 30px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);\n--portal-opacity: 0.25;\n```\n\nThere is now a shared language between designers and developers.\n\n### Create or identify an icon set.\n\n<a\n  aria-label=\"Icon set\"\n  href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/6632346-Zoom-Redesign-Icon-Library\"\n>\n  <Image\n    alt={`Icon set`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/icons.png`}\n    width={800}\n    height={600}\n  />\n</a>\n\nIf you already have existing icons, you'll need to determine which to keep. It might not make sense to create your own icons depending on the size and priorities of your company. You might be better off utilizing an open-source icon library. Here are some examples:\n\n- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)\n- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)\n- [Material UI Icons](https://material-ui.com/components/icons/)\n- [Eva Icons](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/)\n- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com)\n- [Styled Icons](https://styled-icons.js.org/)\n- [Ikonate](https://ikonate.com/)\n\nRegardless if you build your own or use open source, you should standardize on usage and identify consumption patterns. It's also worth considering who are the end-users of your icons set - designers, developers, and marketing?\n\nUsing SVGs, you can make the icon library your single source of truth. Your process might look like this:\n\n1.  Designers create/provide raw SVGs.\n2.  Optimize and compress the SVGs using [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo/).\n3.  Automatically create React components using [SVGR](https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr) for developers.\n4.  Output PNGs and JPEGs at different sizes/resolutions for marketing.\n5.  Compile SVGs into a [bundled font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/icon-font-generator) for mobile applications to use.\n\n### Choose languages/frameworks supported.\n\nWhat languages or frameworks are you currently supporting? Which should the component library support?\nIt's important to think about this ahead of time so you can properly architecture your library.\n\nIf you have an application which uses script tags instead of [ES Modules](https://flaviocopes.com/es-modules/), then you'll need to\nconfigure your component library to bundle into a single distributable file. For example,\na vanilla JavaScript application would need something like this in an HTML file.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"/js/component-library.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nTo achieve this, you can use either [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).\nI would recommend Webpack, as it's the industry standard. I'd also recommend [TSDX](https://github.com/formium/tsdx) if you want to use TypeScript.\n\n### Evaluate Monorepo vs. single package.\n\nA [Monorepo](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo) allows you to build and publish multiple libraries from a single repo.  While it does solve some very real problems, it also creates others. It's important to understand the pros and cons.\n\n<a\n  aria-label=\"Monorepo\"\n  href=\"https://www.toptal.com/front-end/guide-to-monorepos\"\n>\n  <Image\n    alt={`Monorepo`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/monorepo.png`}\n    width={1467}\n    height={583}\n  />\n</a>\n\n<ProsCard\n  title=\"a monorepo\"\n  pros={[\n    'Small bundle sizes by decreasing the scope of components included in one package.',\n    'Shared built, lint, test, and release process for multiple packages versus separate repositories with duplicated code.',\n    'More granular control of semver on a package-by-package basis.',\n  ]}\n/>\n\n<ConsCard\n  title=\"a monorepo\"\n  cons={[\n    'Additional tooling and infrastructure needed.',\n    'Consumers are required to import from a variety of packages instead of one single component library.',\n    `Cutting edge technology. There is industry adoption, but you can run into issues very few have experienced without a clear path for a solution.`,\n  ]}\n/>\n\nSome questions that will help you identify which solution is right for your company.\n\n- Do you currently have multiple repositories all publishing to NPM?\n- Is your build, test, lint infrastructure complex? Is it duplicated in many places?\n- How many repositories do you have (or plan to have in the next year?)\n- How large is your team? How many people will be consuming the component library?\n- Will it be open-source? Can you lean on others in the industry to help solve problems?\n- Do you see the need for multiple packages in the future? (e.g. icons, [codemods](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), etc)\n\nFor most smaller companies, I would argue that a Monorepo is unnecessary. It has its time and place. [I've used it before](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo) with (~150 developers) to distribute 10 different packages at once, spanning both internal and external apps.\n\n**Note:** Want to use a Monorepo? Check out [Building a Design System Monorepo with Turborepo](/blog/turborepo-design-system-monorepo).\n\n### Evaluate CSS/Sass vs. CSS-in-JS.\n\nCSS-in-JS is the easiest solution for bundling styles and distributing through NPM.\nFor optimal performance, consider using a near-zero runtime solution like [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/).\n\nIf your component library needs to output raw HTML/CSS, I'd recommend sticking with Sass. A great example of this is IBM's [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/code).\nYou can use [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to contain your [design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Design System Button`}\n  src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/button.png`}\n  width={821}\n  height={154}\n/>\n\n```html\n<button class=\"bx--btn bx--btn--primary\" type=\"button\">Button</button>\n```\n\nIf you're using React, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react)\n\n### Create a component library.\n\nWith your technical requirements defined and your style guide started, you should now be able\nto begin constructing a component library. My recommendation would be to use **React alongside [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**.\n\n<a aria-label=\"Component Driven Development\" href=\"https://storybook.js.org/\">\n  <Image\n    alt={`Component Driven Development`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/component-driven-development.jpg`}\n    width={1000}\n    height={537}\n  />\n</a>\n\n**Creating a component library is much more than just translating the style guide into code.**\n\nYou'll need to think about how consumers will interact with your components.\nWhat sort of API would they expect? What provides the most clarity and is self-documenting?\nFor example, consider buttons. You have different variations of buttons - primary, secondary, etc.\n\n<a aria-label=\"Buttons\" href=\"https://eva.design/\">\n  <Image\n    alt={`Buttons`}\n    src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/buttons.png`}\n    width={1000}\n    height={641}\n  />\n</a>\n\nShould you have separate components for each?\n\n```jsx\n<PrimaryButton>Hello World!</PrimaryButton>\n<SecondaryButton>Hello World!</SecondaryButton>\n```\n\nor should you use a prop?\n\n```jsx\n<Button>Hello World!</Button>\n<Button variant=\"secondary\">Hello World!</Button>\n```\n\nSecondarily, what should the prop be called? `variant`? `type`? Did you consider that type is a [reserved attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_type.asp) for the HTML `<button>` element? These are the type of decisions that you will need to make as you build your component library.\n\nSome other things you might want to consider:\n\n- Should you allow consumers to [pass CSS properties](https://evergreen.segment.com/components/layout-primitives) in as props to the React components, or should they have to extend/wrap components to achieve their desired styling? If you choose the former, consider [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system).\n- Should you build loading states [directly into components](http://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/accordion--skeleton), or should there be a [generic component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loading-skeleton) for loading (spinner, skeleton?)\n- How should you test purely visual components? [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)? [Visual diff testing](https://www.chromaticqa.com/)?\n- What will consumers need to do to integrate with your component library? Should there be a [global style reset](https://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/)? Should they add any [Babel plugins](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import)?\n- Should you utilize [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) to auto-generate a changelog?\n- Will your components need to support web _and_ mobile? Consider using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to share code across platforms.\n\n### Choose a documentation platform.\n\nYou need a platform to display your design system.\nIf you're just getting started, I would recommend using **[Storybook Docs](https://medium.com/storybookjs/storybook-docs-sneak-peak-5be78445094a)**.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Storybook Docs`}\n  src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/storybook-docs.png`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={614}\n/>\n\nThis combination will achieve the output as other similar platforms like [Docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz), [Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/), and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).\n\n- Easily copy code snippets from component examples\n- Auto-generate a props table based on `prop-types` and `defaultProps`\n- Easily view all permutations of a component\n- Write custom docs using MDX\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Storybook Flow`}\n  src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/storybook-flow.png`}\n  width={1300}\n  height={378}\n/>\n\nIf you're adamant on your design system reflecting your brand and dogfooding your component library,\nI would recommend a custom solution using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). This will allow you to insert React components\ninside Markdown files. The blog you're reading right now [uses this](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).\n\nHaving a truly custom solution allows you full control over your docs.\nOne example I'm extremely impressed by is [Atomize React](https://atomizecode.com/docs/react/atoms).\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Atomize React`}\n  src={`/images/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/atomize.png`}\n  width={1300}\n  height={675}\n/>\n\n### Write design system documentation.\n\nNow that you've chosen a documentation platform, it's time to write the docs. You should include:\n\n- Installation and setup instruction for the component library\n- Props schemas and type definitions for each component\n- Component examples along with copyable code snippets\n- Technology choices and rationale\n\nConsider also adding:\n\n- A \"Getting Started\" section involving a tutorial\n- Completed UI templates to choose from\n- Information about theming\n- A live code playground for interacting with components\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI've spent a lot of time in the past year thinking about design systems.\nBuilding a component library from the ground up gave me a new appreciation\nfor the amount of work that goes into front-end development and design.\nBelow, you'll find a list of design systems which have inspired me and serve as great resources.\n\nFeel free to [reach out](mailto:me@leerob.io) if you wanna chat about building design systems.\n\n## Resources\n\n**Design Systems**\n\n- [Shopify's Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/)\n- [Segment's Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/)\n- [Eva Design](https://eva.design)\n- [Vercel's Design System](https://vercel.com/design)\n- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)\n- [IBM's Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)\n- [Storybook's Design System](https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system)\n- [Modulz's Radix](https://radix.modulz.app/docs/getting-started/)\n- [GitHub's Primer](https://primer.style/)\n- [Palantir's Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/)\n- [Atlassian's Design System](https://atlassian.design/)\n- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)\n",

    "title": "Switching to Tailwind CSS",
    "publishedAt": "2020-12-14",
    "summary": "Learn why I switched my Next.js blog to use Tailwind CSS and how it impacted performance.",
    "body": {
      "raw": "\nMy site is an opportunity to try new tech and form opinions on what I enjoy using. I learn best by building real things. After some evaluation, I've landed on the following tech stack:\n\n- Next.js (Upgraded to `v10`)\n- Tailwind CSS (Switched from Chakra UI)\n- `next-mdx-remote` (Switched from `next-mdx-enhanced`)\n- Deployed with Vercel\n\nI've improved performance, added new features, and cleaned up some code. Let's dive into why I chose this tech stack.\n\n### Next.js 10\n\nNext.js 10 introduced the [Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization). I've optimized images manually before (using ImageAlpha / ImageOptim) as well as with automated tools (like ImgBot). With Next.js 10, I no longer need to worry about that.\n\nThe `Image` component helps prevent [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS) by defining the `width` and `height` ahead of time. No more jumping layouts. It only loads images as they're scrolled into the viewport, keeping page loads fast. Plus, images are served in modern formats like [WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) when the browser supports it.\n\nPreventing CLS required a mental model shift. Previously, my images used normal Markdown image syntax and expanded to fill the width of their container (`700px`). For example:\n\n```jsx\n![Siamese Cat](/cat.png)\n```\n\nI wanted to avoid using the `height` and `width` props of `next/image`, if possible. The `Image` component exposes different [layout props](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#layout) like `layout=fill`, which led to me believe I could [escape defining sizes](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/image-component/pages/layout-fill.js). In reality, there's no way to avoid layout shift unless you explicitly tell the layout how much space to allocate. Once that clicked in my head, the `Image` component made sense.\n\nThis meant switching from Markdown image syntax (shown above) to using `next/image` via MDX. Since I had hundreds of Markdown files, I wanted to automate this. I created a [Node script using remark](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/fb9c02b76128d91717a226e5c118b5c56e11696e/scripts/markdown-to-next-image.js) that transformed every image and read the dimensions from the file system. For example, the above Markdown image was transformed to:\n\n```jsx\n<Image alt=\"Siamese Cat\" src=\"/cat.png\" height={50} width={50} />\n```\n\n### Tailwind CSS\n\nAt first glance, Tailwind seems horrible. I've heard this sentiment many times and read [Adam's rebuttals](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/). Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to try Tailwind on a project. I didn't hate it. Still, I needed a larger project to form an opinion on the framework.\n\nWell, the verdict is out. **I really enjoy Tailwind.** There was a learning curve as I tried to translate my existing CSS knowledge to Tailwind specific naming. For example, this vanilla CSS:\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: row;\nalign-items: center;\n```\n\ntranslates to these utility classes with Tailwind:\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"flex flex-row items-center\" />\n```\n\nThe Tailwind classes feel intuitive and their documentation makes it easy. The underlying idea of being bound to a design system made plenty of sense coming from Chakra UI. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Flex } from '@chakra-ui/react';\n\n<Flex px={4} py={2} />;\n```\n\nChakra's [spacing system](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme#spacing) is inspired by Tailwind. 1 spacing unit is equal to `0.25rem`, which translates to `4px` by default in most browsers. In the example below, we're adding `16px` of horizontal padding and `8px` of vertical padding.\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"px-4 py-2\" />\n```\n\nI still enjoy Chakra for larger applications. Having pre-built UI components saves a lot of time. Their documentation has some good notes on the [differences between Tailwind](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/comparison#how-is-chakra-different-from-tailwind-css). For further reading, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react).\n\n### Dark Mode\n\nTailwind 2.0 makes using dark mode painless. Enable the `dark` [variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) and prefix your classes with `dark:`. That's pretty much it.\n\n```jsx\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800\" />\n```\n\nI was able to keep a [dark mode toggle](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/components/Container.tsx) in the navigation thanks to [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes). Tailwind and `next-themes` [pair well](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes#with-tailwind) together.\n\n```jsx\nimport { useTheme } from 'next-themes';\n\nconst ThemeChanger = () => {\n  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      The current theme is: {theme}\n      <button onClick={() => setTheme('light')}>Light Mode</button>\n      <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>Dark Mode</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nI hit a few issues along the way adding dark mode to Tailwind Typography. The documentation felt a bit disjointed from the rest of Tailwind. I would have expected more guidance on pairing the two together.\n\nAfter digging through GitHub Issues, I was able to [get things working](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/tailwind.config.js). It wasn't obvious I needed `dark:prose-dark`. I also managed to get [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/91233631f0e1a193295ffc54d2291f3109060007/styles/global.css) working through some custom styles.\n\n## Performance\n\nLibraries like `emotion` and `styled-system` require runtime JavaScript to compute styles and generate class names. That doesn't mean you can't use [CSS-in-JS](https://github.com/callstack/linaria) [correctly](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro). But I'd argue using \"plain\" CSS helps you fall into the [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/) ([CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support), Tailwind, etc) more easily.\n\nThere is no correct answer. Each has their own tradeoffs. For my simple site, I choose the performance tradeoff. I was able to reduce the [number of assets downloaded](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#build) **by 43%**.\n\n- 📦 Before → `~150kb` First Load JS\n- 📈 After → `~85kb` First Load JS\n\nThis change, paired with `next/image`, has my [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) looking incredible. Zero CLS.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Vercel Analytics`}\n  src={`/images/tailwind/analytics.jpg`}\n  width={1000}\n  height={782}\n/>\n\n### MDX\n\n[Last year](/blog/mdx), I switched from using `@next/mdx` to `next-mdx-enhanced` mostly for front matter and layout support. These are now both [solved problems](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown). Given that [next-mdx-enhanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) will likely be deprecated soon (see below) I wanted to explore [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).\n\n> You probably should be using `next-mdx-remote` instead of this library. It is ~50% faster, more flexible with content storage, does not induce memory issues at scale, and fits much better with the way that data is intended to flow through Next.js.\n\nWith the addition of `getStaticPaths` / `getServerSideProps`, you can treat your MDX data like any other data source in Next.js. It also removes the limitation of being bound to [file-system based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for your `.mdx` files. Since my site has hundreds of MDX files, moving these to a top-level `data/` folder made more sense to me.\n\nStill, the MDX experience feels _fragmented_. I'd like to merge `next-mdx-remote` with `@next/mdx` so there are fewer options. [nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) (another related project) allows you to use methods like `getStaticProps` directly inside your MDX files. Maybe there's a path to convergence for all three.\n\n### Other\n\nI added [absolute Imports and module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) to improve the readability of nested imports inside files. Here's a before and after example:\n\n```jsx\n// Before\nimport db from '../../lib/db-admin';\n\n// After\nimport db from 'lib/db-admin';\n```\n",
      "code": "var Component=(()=>{var h=Object.create;var r=Object.defineProperty;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var y=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var m=Object.getPrototypeOf,B=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var g=(l,e)=>()=>(e||l((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),f=(l,e)=>{for(var t in e)r(l,t,{get:e[t],enumerable:!0})},i=(l,e,t,o)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let a of y(e))!B.call(l,a)&&a!==t&&r(l,a,{get:()=>e[a],enumerable:!(o=p(e,a))||o.enumerable});return l};var u=(l,e,t)=>(t=l!=null?h(m(l)):{},i(e||!l||!l.__esModule?r(t,\"default\",{value:l,enumerable:!0}):t,l)),b=l=>i(r({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),l);var s=g((k,c)=>{c.exports=_jsx_runtime});var F={};f(F,{default:()=>w,frontmatter:()=>x});var n=u(s()),x={title:\"Switching to Tailwind CSS\",publishedAt:\"2020-12-14\",summary:\"Learn why I switched my Next.js blog to use Tailwind CSS and how it impacted performance.\"};function d(l){let e=Object.assign({p:\"p\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",code:\"code\",h3:\"h3\",a:\"a\",span:\"span\",div:\"div\",pre:\"pre\",strong:\"strong\",h2:\"h2\",blockquote:\"blockquote\",em:\"em\"},l.components),{Image:t}=e;return t||A(\"Image\",!0),(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"My site is an opportunity to try new tech and form opinions on what I enjoy using.

      "raw": "\nSix months ago, I had an idea for an online course. Today, I've taught students all over the world and **made over $7,000 teaching online.**\n\nYou can do the same. Here's my story.\n\n## Writing Online\n\nI've been [writing online](/blog) since 2014. I would condense and simplify pieces of information I learned into helpful articles.\nAt the time, I wrote for myself––I needed to keep my skills sharp.\n\nI repurposed the knowledge I was paid to learn at work into content for others.\nAfter five years of writing online, I hadn't made a single dollar. All of the content I produced was free.\nI saw other creators [making millions](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/098-adam-wathan-of-refactoring-ui) teaching online. Why couldn't I do the same?\n\nI realized I hadn't been giving away my content for free. I was building an audience and establishing credibility.\n\n## Credibility\n\nWriting online is difficult. Clearly explaining technical content is twice as hard.\nYou have to understand the subject deep enough that you can explain it at an entry-level. Many fail at this.\n\nOver the past six years, I created my niche with front-end web development.\nI started a [small newsletter](/newsletter) where I'd share my latest writing with my audience.\nI'd distribute my content to [social media](https://twitter.com/leeerob). Occasionally, a post would go viral on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/cn8c3l/everything_i_know_about_style_guides_design/) or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23079289).\n\nSlowly, I became credible in my niche. My tutorials and blog posts [helped others learn](/blog/why-i-create-open-source-software).\nI established myself as an \"expert\". I say expert, but you can do this.\n\nMost people spend the majority of their time online consuming instead of creating. Be a creator.\nI focused on writing about topics I found interesting. Along the way, I built an audience.\n\n## Building an Audience through Learning\n\nWhen I learned something new, I would share it––with my [newsletter](/newsletter), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leeerob), everywhere.\nI gave value to my audience. The content I created for myself was now a reference for others.\n\nOver time, this grew into a hub of inbound traffic to my website.\nToday, over [80% of my traffic](/dashboard) comes from organic Google Searches.\n**Without an audience, you cannot sell a product.**\nBe helpful on the internet and you will create an audience.\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, I became obsessed with a specific technology called [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).\nIt allowed me to create websites faster. I rebuilt my website using it and documented the process along the way.\nI continued to write about Next.js that year. In September, I realized I'd found my niche.\n\n## Finding Your Market\n\nIt's impossible to measure your success if you can't [track it](/dashboard).\nWhatever your metric is (post views, number of likes), you need a baseline to improve.\n\nI use [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/T93GOJ) and Google Search Console to monitor the performance of my site.\nI'm able to see which articles perform best and how people find my site.\nTo my surprise, almost all of my highest ranked articles were about [Next.js](/blog/things-ive-learned-building-nextjs-apps). I'd found my market.\n\nCreating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier.\nDon’t create a product, then seek someone to sell it to. Find a market—define your customers—then find or develop a product for them.\n\n## Creating a Course\n\nThe idea of creating an online course seemed daunting. It would take six months, at least.\nBased on my analytics, people were interested––but would they buy it?\n\nAfter researching teaching online and marketing, I had a eureka moment.\nTo figure out if people would buy the course, I would launch it. _Now._\nWhy should I treat this course any different than a software product?\nWith software, you can start small and rapidly iterate over time. I applied the same methodology to the course.\n\nFirst, I defined the content. I created an outline for the course I wish I had when starting to learn Next.js.\nWorking backward, I made a list of 15-20 main concepts to cover.\nThen, I [created a website](https://masteringnextjs.com/) to market the course and allow people to pre-order.\nThe main benefit of your course should be explainable in one sentence or phrase. How is it different, and why should I buy it?\n\nOn November 3rd, [I launched the course](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1191131502131765249).\n\nI placed a small bet––only 15-20% of the content was finished. If this launch failed and no one bought the course,\nI'd cut my losses and walk away. Instead of wasting the next six months, I wanted validation now people would pay for this.\n\nI intentionally priced the course high at $199, with a launch price of $99. With ten pre-orders, I'd have $1,000 of revenue.\nNo cards were charged––I wasn't stealing their money. I was validating my idea and confirming I had a market.\nWith no idea how long it would take to create the course, I set a launch date of April 2020.\n\n**Two days after the launch, I had my first sale.** It was breathtaking.\nSomeone on the internet spent $100 on a digital asset I created. I couldn't believe it.\n\nThe next day, another sale. And another the day after.\nIn the first week, I made seven sales for $700 in profit. I was motivated to continue working.\n\n## Should I Use A Platform?\n\nYou'll need to make two platform choices: how to accept payments and where to host content.\nFor payments, I'd recommend [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/), [Paddle](https://paddle.com/), or [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).\nDepending on your volume of sales, there are different processing fees.\n[This article](https://activegrowth.com/stripe-vs-paypal-vs-gumroad-how-to-sell-ebooks/) goes more in-depth about how fees compare across platforms.\n\nThe second decision is where to host your content.\nFor e-books or a small number of videos, I'd recommend Gumroad.\nIf you have a large video course, YouTube (with private videos) worked well for me.\nAnother option is a fully-managed online course platform like [Teachable](https://teachable.com/).\n\n## Marketing & Advertising\n\n[Writing online](/blog/content-marketing-personal-brand) was effective at growing my site, so I took the same approach for the course.\nI wrote [three articles](https://masteringnextjs.com/blog) to attract inbound traffic from social media and search engines.\nI released a [26-minute introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQeidE2LA1s) on YouTube.\nNot only did this promote the course, but it further established my credibility. The video has over 2,500 views, almost all from organic searches.\n\nProviding value by giving is the fastest way to grow.\nIf your audience has learned from you, they'll want more.\nOnly after you've provided value can you sell a product.\nTo give back, I ran a [Twitter giveaway](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1216020603020378113) for the course. Initially, I planned for five winners.\nThe response was so overwhelming that I ended up giving away ten instead.\n\nI spent $0 and reached 7,331 potential customers. Here's the full statistics on that tweet.\n\n- Impressions: 7,331\n- Engagements: 488\n- Detail expands: 119\n- Profile clicks: 101\n- Link clicks: 72\n\nI realized it was time to spend money on advertising.\n\n## Advertising\n\nMy first attempt at advertising was through [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/).\nAgain, I started with a small bet of $5/day. The initial results were promising.\n\n- Impressions: 5,255\n- Clicks: 24\n- Ad Spend: $26.75\n- Sales: 2 x ($99)\n- Profit: **$171.25**\n\nComparing impressions against Twitter shows how valuable of an asset it can be.\nI continued advertising with Google, increasing the daily spend to $20/day for another week. Here are the final numbers.\n\n- Impressions: 53,357\n- Clicks: 189\n- Ad Spend: $208.91\n- Sales: 6 x ($99)\n- Profit: **$385**\n\nI also tried [Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising). I iterated over a few ads with this approach.\n\n1. Use A/B tests to try different ads\n1. Take the ad with a higher click-through rate\n1. Rinse and repeat\n\nI'd optimize each ad by targeting specific subreddits.\nFor example, this subreddit had twice the click-through rate for the same cost-per-click.\n\n<Image\n  alt={`Reddit ad results`}\n  src={`/images/teach-online/reddit.png`}\n  width={699}\n  height={277}\n/>\n\nEven though I was new to advertising, it played a critical role in growing the course.\nNow, I needed to launch.\n\n## Launch Day\n\nFor months, I worked closely with early customers to get feedback on the course.\nFeeling confident, I soft-launched with 95% of the content finished.\n\nAfter a week with no issues, it was time for the real launch.\nI posted to [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mastering-next-js), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/f2jbek/launched_a_programming_video_course_and_made_2000/), [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/mastering-next-js), and everywhere else I could.\nBy the time I had launched, I had $2,000 in pre-orders.\n\n**Ten days later, I broke $3,000.**\n\nWhen I started the course, my original goal was $5,000 _in total_.\nI thought that seemed aggressive. In retrospect, I aimed too low.\nNever underestimate the power of teaching online.\n\nSince launching in February 2020, I've surpassed $7,000 in revenue.\nI'm averaging ~$1,500/month, putting me on track to make **$18,000 this year**.\n\n## You Should Teach Online\n\nThere's never been a better time to become a creator.\nBlog posts, YouTube videos, courses, podcasts, streaming––if you have something others find value in, share it.\nPublish that article. Make that video.\n\nStop waiting for a once in a lifetime idea and start teaching others online today.\nThe opportunity outweighs your fears. Even if your audience is small, teaching others\nwill improve your understanding of the subject.\n\nMy story isn't unique. Here are some other creators that inspired me.\n\n- [Adam Wathan](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/098-adam-wathan-of-refactoring-ui) made $2.5MM from books/courses.\n- [Daniel Vassallo](https://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1256245508688842752) made $100K from a book and video course.\n- [Emma Bostian](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1258367502041714689) made $40K before her book even launched.\n\nNever underestimate the power of teaching online.\n",

    "body": {
      "raw": "\nI've spent a lot of time in the past 4 months creating [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps for both work and personal use.\n\n- I ported over my personal site from [Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) to [Next.js + MDX](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io).\n- I created [dsmtech.io](https://dsmtech.io/) (and explored using [Mapbox](/blog/using-mapbox-with-next-js)).\n- A handful of projects at [Hy-Vee](https://innovate.hy-vee.com/) are being [rebuilt with Next.js](https://stackshare.io/hy-vee/hy-vee-aisles-online).\n\nAlong that journey, I've grown to really ❤ Next.js and it's ecosystem. Here are some of the things I've learned along the way.\n\n## CSS Modules\n\nI've worked with CSS, Sass, CSS-in-JS, and now CSS Modules. For most applications, I'd recommend CSS Modules.\n\nCSS Modules prevent naming collisions and keep you from loading excess styling.\nThey're built [directly into Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css), making it easy to get started.\n\nFor more information, check out [How Should I Style My React Application?](/blog/css-with-react)\n\n## Font Loading\n\nBy using `@font-face` in combination with the `font-display` [attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display), I can prevent FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) and FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text).\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  font-family: 'Inter';\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: 100 900;\n  font-display: optional;\n  src: url(/fonts/inter-var-latin.woff2) format('woff2');\n  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA,\n    U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215,\n    U+FEFF, U+FFFD;\n}\n```\n\nFurther, I can [preload](https://web.dev/preload-critical-assets/) my optimized font file in the `Head` of my document.\n\n**Update:** For more information, check out [Web Fonts in 2021](/blog/fonts).\n\n## Dynamic Imports and Testing\n\nIt's likely that at some point in scaling your Next.js app, you'll want to use an external package\nthat doesn't work well server-side rendered. For me, this package was [react-select](https://react-select.com).\n\nWhen SSR this component, it simply did not work in Safari. Until that bug is fixed, I needed a workaround. Thanks\nto Next's [Dynamic Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/#dynamic-import), it's easy to import a component and disable SSR.\n\n```jsx\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic';\n\nconst ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {\n  ssr: false,\n});\n\nexport default () => (\n  <>\n    <Header />\n    <ReactSelectNoSSR />\n    <Footer />\n  </>\n);\n```\n\nWhile this works, we can go a step further and provide a [loading placeholder](/blog/loading-placeholder-with-sass) to make the user experience better.\n\n```jsx\nconst ReactSelectNoSSR = dynamic(() => import('../components/select'), {\n  loading: () => <Input />,\n  ssr: false,\n});\n```\n\n## MDX\n\nMy [portfolio](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) has transformed quite a bit since I started it in 2014. Originally, it was\njust static HTML & CSS. Then, I [switched over to Hugo](/blog/migrating-to-hugo) so I could write my posts in Markdown.\nThis worked well for a while, but I wanted full control over my layouts and felt much more comfortable with JavaScript.\nThat's what led me to Next.js and MDX.\n\nWith [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx), I can use JSX components inside my Markdown documents with ease. This way, if I want to do\nsomething custom, it's as simple as importing a React component.\n\n## Link Prefetching\n\nFor maximum performance, you can use the `prefetch` [attribute](https://nextjs.org/docs#prefetching-pages) on Next's `<Link>` component. This will give the perception\nthe page loads instantly.\n\n- As of [Next.js 8](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-8/), `prefetch` uses `<link rel=\"preload\">` instead of a `<script>` tag. It also only starts prefetching after `onload` to allow the browser to manage resources.\n- As of [Next.js 9](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9/), `<Link>` components will be [automatically prefetched](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#prefetching-in-viewport-links) as they appear in-viewport. You no longer need to explicitly say `prefetch`.\n- As of [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13/), you no longer need to manually add `a` tags as a child of `<Link>` components.\n\n```jsx\n<Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n```\n\n## Polyfills\n\nNext.js supports all modern browsers (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) out of the box.\nHowever, it's possible that your own code or external NPM dependencies might use features not supported in your target browsers. In this case,\nyou will need to [add polyfills](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/supported-browsers-features#custom-polyfills).\n\nYou'll need to add a top-level import for the specific polyfill you need in your Custom `<App>` or the individual component.\n\n```js title=\"pages/_app.js\"\n// Add your polyfills here or at the component level.\n// For example...\n// import 'resize-observer-polyfill'\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />;\n}\n```\n\n## Vercel\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is hands down the **easiest way to deploy applications** I've ever used.\nIt's incredibly easy to get started and their GitHub integration will automatically deploy your app on pull requests and leave a link\nfor you to review the changes. If everything looks good, it will deploy to prod when the PR is merged. Simple as that.\n\nThe icing on the cake is how well the Vercel ecosystem works together. Their [domain service](https://vercel.com/domains) allows you\nto buy domains _from the command line_. I've never been able to go from an idea to a live, deployed application\nhosted on a domain so fast. I was even able to setup email forwarding for my domain and create `me@leerob.io` using [improvmx](https://improvmx.com/) 🎉\n\n**Update:** I work at Vercel now. This was written before, but still holds true 😁\n\n## Where To Get Help\n\nThe Next.js and Vercel community support is _fantastic_. They're very responsive to emails, issues, or any other form\nof contact. My preferred method would be [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions). Thanks to Discussions, all\nquestions and answers are indexed, searchable, and easy to find. Their [tutorials](https://nextjs.org/learn/) and [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) are also fantastic and well-written.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Mastering Next.js](https://masteringnextjs.com/)\n- [React 2025](https://react2025.com/)\n- [Official Learn Tutorial](http://nextjs.org/learn)\n",

It was designed after the workflows used by massive software engineering organizations to ship code at scale. Turborepo abstracts the complex configuration needed for monorepos and provides fast, incremental builds with zero-configuration remote caching.\n\nUsing Turborepo simplifes managing your design system monorepo, as you can have a single lint, build, test, and release process for all packages. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software) about how monorepos improve your development workflow.\n\n## Apps & Packages\n\nThis Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:\n\n- `apps/docs`: Component documentation site with Storybook\n- `packages/@acme/core`: Core React components\n- `packages/@acme/utils`: Shared React utilities\n- `packages/@acme/tsconfig`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo\n- `packages/eslint-preset-acme`: ESLint preset\n\nEach package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Yarn Workspaces enables us to \"hoist\" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-W` workspaces flag with `yarn add`.\n\nThis example sets up your `.gitignore` to exclude all generated files, other folders like `node_modules` used to store your dependencies.\n\n### Compilation\n\nTo make the core library code work across all browsers, we need to compile the raw TypeScript and React code to plain JavaScript. We can accomplish this with `tsup`, which uses `esbuild` to greatly improve performance.\n\nRunning `yarn build` from the root of the Turborepo will run the `build` command defined in each package's `package.json` file. Turborepo runs each `build` in parallel and caches & hashes the output to speed up future builds.\n\nFor `acme-core`, the `build` command is the following:\n\n```bash\ntsup src/index.tsx --format esm,cjs --dts --external react\n```\n\n`tsup` compiles `src/index.tsx`, which exports all of the components in the design system, into both ES Modules and CommonJS formats as well as their TypeScript types. The `package.json` for `acme-core` then instructs the consumer to select the correct format:\n\n```json title=\"acme-core/package.json\"\n{\n  \"name\": \"@acme/core\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"./dist/index.js\",\n  \"module\": \"./dist/index.mjs\",\n  \"types\": \"./dist/index.d.ts\",\n  \"sideEffects\": false\n}\n```\n\nRun `yarn build` to confirm compilation is working correctly. You should see a folder `acme-core/dist` which contains the compiled output.\n\n```bash\nacme-core\n└── dist\n    ├── index.t.ts  <-- Types\n    ├── index.js    <-- CommonJS version\n    └── index.mjs   <-- ES Modules version\n```\n\n## Components\n\nEach file inside of `acme-core/src` is a component inside our design system. For example:\n\n```tsx title=\"acme-core/src/Button.tsx\"\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\nexport interface ButtonProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport function Button(props: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button>{props.children}</button>;\n}\n\nButton.displayName = 'Button';\n```\n\nWhen adding a new file, ensure the component is also exported from the entry `index.tsx` file:\n\n```tsx title=\"acme-core/src/index.tsx\"\nimport * as React from 'react';\nexport { Button, type ButtonProps } from './Button';\n// Add new component exports here\n```\n\n## Storybook\n\nStorybook provides us with an interactive UI playground for our components. This allows us to preview our components in the browser and instantly see changes when developing locally. This example preconfigures Storybook to:\n\n- Use Vite to bundle stories instantly (in milliseconds)\n- Automatically find any stories inside the `stories/` folder\n- Support using module path aliases like `@acme/core` for imports\n- Write MDX for component documentation pages\n\nFor example, here's the included Story for our `Button` component:\n\n```js title=\"apps/docs/stories/button.stories.mdx\"\nimport { Button } from '@acme/core/src';\nimport { Meta, Story, Preview, Props } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';\n\n<Meta title=\"Components/Button\" component={Button} />\n\n# Button\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec euismod, nisl eget consectetur tempor, nisl nunc egestas nisi, euismod aliquam nisl nunc euismod.\n\n## Props\n\n<Props of={Box} />\n\n## Examples\n\n<Preview>\n  <Story name=\"Default\">\n    <Button>Hello</Button>\n  </Story>\n</Preview>\n```\n\nThis example includes a few helpful Storybook scripts:\n\n- `yarn dev`: Starts Storybook in dev mode with hot reloading at `localhost:6006`\n- `yarn build`: Builds the Storybook UI and generates the static HTML files\n- `yarn preview-storybook`: Starts a local server to view the generated Storybook UI\n\n## Versioning & Publishing Packages\n\nThis example uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediatley.\n\nYou'll need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add it to your GitHub repository settings to enable access to npm. It's also worth installing the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your repository.\n\n### Generating the Changelog\n\nTo generate your changelog, run `yarn changeset` locally:\n\n1. **Which packages would you like to include?** – This shows which packages and changed and which have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the packages you want to include in the `changeset`.\n1. **Which packages should have a major bump?** – Press `space` to select the packages you want to bump versions for.\n1. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.\n1. Write a summary for the changes.\n1. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.\n1. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the packages included.\n\n### Releasing\n\nWhen you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:\n\n```bash\nturbo run build --filter=docs^... && changeset publish\n```\n\nTurborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding docs) and publishes the packages to npm. By default, this example includes `acme` as the npm organization. To change this, do the following:\n\n- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `acme` with your desired scope\n- Search and replace `acme` with your desired scope\n- Re-run `yarn install`\n\nTo publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the following from each of the `package.json`'s\n\n```diff\n- \"publishConfig\": {\n-  \"access\": \"public\"\n- },\n```\n",

      "raw": "\nCreating open-source software makes me happy. It’s an opportunity for me to showcase my programming skills and gain experience with new languages and frameworks. I don’t make any money from it. I’ve actually _lost_ money on most websites I’ve created from buying domain names.\n\nOver four years ago, I wrote [this article](/blog/space-invaders-with-python)\nabout how I created a clone of Space Invaders with Python. I really enjoyed creating the game and wanted to share it with others, so [I put it on my GitHub.](https://github.com/leerob/Space_Invaders)\n\nI also [posted it to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3d7rf3/space_invaders_clone_using_pygame/), where it got lots of good feedback. My favorite comment was:\n\n> \"You might not realize it, but you just finished 1000's of Python students final projects.\"\n\nOver the years, it’s gathered **~200 stars** and **~200 forks** on GitHub. A few issues have been opened and some contributors have helped fixed bugs. However, I would have never expected the amount of interest it would bring.\n\n### Years Later\n\nI included my email address in the README. I’ve had _several_ emails asking about how I did certain parts and for help code reviewing their versions. One group of students created a research project on top of the game where the AI controls the ship and plays the game. Another group of students used the [NEAT algorithm](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html) to create an artificial neural network which scored as many points as possible.\n\nThe best, however, came just a few weeks ago. I received an email from Stuart Fox. [Stuart](http://stuartfoxmusic.com/) is a composer, tech hobbyist, and mentor from the U.K. Here's what he had to say:\n\n> \"Thought I’d thank you for the great Space Invaders game. I had an idea of getting the kids at our local Raspberry Pi Jam to build a Space Invaders controller using buttons, a breadboard and GPIO pins on the Pi.\n> They’ll learn about using libraries to integrate external buttons into their Python programs and when we’ve built the controller, we’ll look at your code and learn how to modify it to work with external buttons.\"\n\nI would have never imagined this little game I created four years ago would be used to help teach kids thousands of miles away at a Raspberry Pi meetup in England.\n\nStuart was kind enough to send pictures back from the event. He said the kids were ecstatic and loved my version of the game. By the time they got it working on their machine, it was hard to keep them focused!\n\nIt’s an amazing feeling to make something others find value in. That’s why I create open-source software.\n",
